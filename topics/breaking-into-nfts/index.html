Breaking into NFTs: A Guide for Artists</h1><p>This presentation is <a href=https://github.com/mprimi/notes/tree/main/content/topics/breaking-into-nfts>open source</a> (<a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0>CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a>)</p><hr><h1 id=breaking-into-nfts-a-guide-for-artists>Breaking into NFTs: A Guide for Artists</h1><p><a href=https://youtu.be/BhKzb_VJ958>Video</a> (pre-recorder/rehearsal with additional content)</p><hr><h1 id=hello-world>Hello World!</h1><p>Thank you to the wonderful folks of <a href=http://www.artogether.org/>ARTogether</a> for organizing this event.</p><p><img src=flyer.png alt="ARTogether - Breaking into NFTs"></p><hr><h1 id=whoami><code>whoami</code></h1><p>Technology enthusiast, Distributed system engineer (I make lots of computers talk to each-other).</p><p>I have an affinity with blockchain due to academic research (10+ years ago).
<strong>Consensus</strong>, the math underlying blockchain technology.</p><p>I have little interest in <em>cryptocurrencies</em> and NFTs.</p><p>Reducing blockchain to cryptocurrency is like reducing music to guitar playing.
The universe of music is bigger than guitars.
The universe of blockchain is bigger than cryptocurrencies.</p><hr><h1 id=technology>Technology</h1><p>Technology can improve people&rsquo;s lives, or worsen it them.
Often it does both at the same time.</p><p>The widespread adoption of the lightbulb made it easy to see in the dark.
But it also made it harder to see the stars.</p><p>Same goes for any other technology.
Agriculture, the steam engine, antibiotics, radioactivity, the internet, smartphones, &mldr;</p><p>Nothing is inherently &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo;.</p><p>Same is true for blockchain.
Polarized opinions pro/against blockchain miss the larger picture.</p><hr><h1 id=trusted-intermediaries>Trusted Intermediaries</h1><p>Before jumping to the future, let&rsquo;s talk about the present.</p><p>Today, we depend on a number of service and companies to do anything.</p><p>To buy toilet paper, use Amazon which puts you in contact with a seller.
This is convenient and secure.</p><p>To talk to your friends, talk to Facebook, they will relay they message for you.</p><p>For better or worse, this is the state of things.</p><p>These companies have a huge amount of power over us.</p><hr><h1 id=a-wild-blockchain-appears>A Wild Blockchain Appears&mldr;</h1><p>I&rsquo;m excited about blockchain because I imagine uses that shift this power un-balance.</p><p>It can help us connect <strong>more directly</strong> to each-other, without a company as intermediary.</p><p>The most famous example is Bitcoin.
A currency that exists outside of the system and outside of the control of governments and banks.</p><p>I am optimistic, but also scared.
Blockchain can be used for things I don&rsquo;t like:</p><ul><li>Increase wealth and power inequality</li><li>Surveillance and control</li><li>Illegal business (scams, tax evasion, trade of illegal items, &mldr;)</li></ul><hr><h1 id=curadaohttpscuradaoio><a href=https://curadao.io/>CuraDAO</a></h1><p>Illustrates the potential of blockchain, when put to good use.</p><p>Cura√ßao citizens re-bootstrapped their economy on the blockchain in 2020</p><ul><li>Tiny island. Economy mostly based on tourism</li><li>Economy collapsed in 2020, skyrocketing inflation</li><li>Local economy rebuilt on blockchain.</li><li>New local currency for locals</li><li>Transactions automatically taxed</li><li>Funds go into common pools spent for projects</li><li>Voting to allocate funds</li><li>No politicians!</li></ul><p>Tiny economy, not gonna happen in the USA. But still an interesting case study.</p><hr><h1 id=daos-escrow-contracts-and-shared-treasury>DAOs, Escrow contracts and shared treasury</h1><p>On a personal note, I do use blockchain to work with and for strangers on the internet.</p><ul><li>Escrow contracts make sure I get paid</li><li>Shared treasury for common needs and projects, spent through voting</li></ul><hr><h1 id=bitcoin-vs-ethereum-vs-blockchain>Bitcoin vs Ethereum vs Blockchain</h1><p>Bitcoin is a <strong>single-purpose</strong> blockchain.
It does exactly one thing: transfer Bitcoin from one wallet to another.
Nobody controls the network, everyone can participate. Everything is open-source.</p><p>Ethereum is a <strong>general purpose</strong> blockchain.
It can be use to create all sorts of decentralized applications (dApps).
Currencies, voting systems, games, many kinds of NFTs, &mldr;</p><p>Blockchain is a method of building decentralized applications.
Dozens of variants exists. With different tradeoffs and advantages.</p><hr><h1 id=elephant-in-the-room-blockchain-is-bad-for-the-environment->Elephant in the room: Blockchain is bad for the environment! üò°</h1><p>It is true that <strong>Bitcoin</strong> (not blockchain) is responsible for a lot of CO2 emissions.</p><p>I like bitcoin but choose not to invest in it, because I don&rsquo;t want to feed the beast.</p><p><img src=eth2-power.png alt="Bitcoin vs Ethereum Power Usage"></p><p>This shines the light on a larger problem in our society: we are not paying the true cost of the pollution we create.</p><p>Every cup of coffee we buy, use, and throw away, generates waste.
Nobody is paying for the true cost of disposal.</p><p>The same is true for everything else we do.</p><p>Bitcoin just makes it very easy to calculate this cost because it&rsquo;s a simple transformation from electricity and (CO2) to money.</p><p>Similar amounts of electricity are wasted posting avocado toast pictures on instagram.
But that&rsquo;s a lot harder to calculate.
And so harder to point the finger to it.</p><p>We need to address this problem at the root, if we want to make a difference.</p><p>Bitcoin is just a symptom.</p><p>Later on: ways blockchain can be <strong>good</strong> for the environment.</p><hr><h1 id=nfts>NFTs</h1><blockquote><p>A 3-letter words known to cause FOMO and anxiety among artists.</p></blockquote><hr><h1 id=the-nft-craze>The NFT craze</h1><p>Nowadays, NFT is synonym with &ldquo;little bit of digital art sold for a ludicrous price&rdquo;</p><p>Great example: &ldquo;Nothing Fucking There&rdquo; QR code in NYC.</p><p><img src=nothing-effin-there.jpg alt="Nothing Fucking There"></p><p>Business model works like this: create something unique and tell as many people as you can.
If even one or two people fall for it, you&rsquo;re rich.</p><p>A billboard in NYC is very expensive. They only need 1 shmuck to make it worth it.</p><p>Reminds me of the &ldquo;I am rich!&rdquo; iPhone app</p><p><img src=iamrich.jpeg alt="I am rich!"></p><hr><h1 id=uniqueness>Uniqueness</h1><p>Auctioning one-of-a-kind NFT is an option.</p><p>&ldquo;Stay Free - Edward Snowden&rdquo;. Raised $5.5M for charity.</p><p><img src=stay-free.png alt="Stay Free - Edward Snowden"></p><p>Public domain art, one person owns &ldquo;bragging rights&rdquo;.</p><p>Each NFT is inherently unique, even if you produce 1000 identical ones.</p><p>Just like each diploma awarded by a university is unique.
We don&rsquo;t need to burn a school down after awarding a single diploma.</p><hr><h1 id=cryptoart>Cryptoart</h1><p>NFTs can be really interesting for digital artists.</p><p>Interesting parallel with piracy boom of late 90s.
Billions were wasted fighting piracy, nothing really worked.</p><p>Legal and convenient ways to watch movies became available (e.g., Netflix, iTunes).
Soon after, piracy dropped significantly.</p><p>NFT could do the same for digital art.</p><p>Most people <em>want</em> to pay for what they take.</p><p>Your art is infinitely replicable at no cost. Preventing copies is a fool&rsquo;s errand.</p><p>I would have paid for all the art I &ldquo;stole&rdquo; for this presentation.</p><hr><h1 id=nft-digital-certificates>NFT: Digital certificates</h1><p>Think of NFTs as micro-certificates that anyone can create, send, receive.</p><p>They can be auto-minted when someone sends you money!</p><p>You don&rsquo;t need to set up a store.</p><hr><h1 id=some-examples>Some examples</h1><hr><h1 id=nft-as-token-of-appreciation>NFT as token of appreciation</h1><h2 id=proof-of-thoughtcare->Proof of thought/care ‚ù§Ô∏è</h2><ul><li>Christmas or birthday cards</li><li>Holiday postcards</li></ul><p>More environmentally friendly than paper that need to be produced, moved, recycled.
They last forever and take no space</p><h2 id=proof-of-presence->Proof of presence üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h2><ul><li>Token of gratitude to event attendees (concerts, shows)</li><li>Memento of a museum, park, or landmark visit</li></ul><p>Collectible, and carry bragging rights</p><hr><h1 id=nft-as-receipt>NFT as receipt</h1><h2 id=proof-of-donation>Proof of donation</h2><ul><li>Receipt of donation to non-profit organization</li><li>Gratitude from an artist or activist you choose to support</li></ul><p>Donor can proudly display them on their homepage/portfolio.</p><p>Example: WWF <a href=https://project-ark.co/>Project Ark</a></p><h2 id=proof-of-purchase>Proof of purchase</h2><ul><li>Receipt for digital album purchase</li><li>Receipt for digital art purchase</li></ul><p>Release an albums for free online, send an NFT to anyone that purchases legally.
Later, supporters could get priority access or discount to concert tickets.</p><hr><h1 id=nft-as-endorsement>NFT as endorsement</h1><h2 id=proof-of-service-provided-or-achievement>Proof of service provided or achievement</h2><ul><li>Employee/student of the month</li><li>Military service</li><li>Sport tournament medal</li></ul><p>More secure and environmentally friendly.</p><h2 id=endorsement>Endorsement</h2><ul><li>Thank your teacher, mentor</li><li>Wonderful person award</li></ul><p>Can be used to build reputation that is otherwise hard to prove.
Can be used as future reference</p><hr><h1 id=this-is-just-the-beginning>This is just the beginning</h1><p>We barely scratched the surface of what is possible with blockchain and NFTs today.</p><p>Today is just the tip of the iceberg compared to what will be possible in a few years.</p><p>I am overall positive and very excited for what&rsquo;s to come (and scared of the unintended consequences).</p><hr><h1 id=one-more-thing>One more thing</h1><p>Crypto art <strong>communities</strong> recommended by friends.</p><h2 id=dada>DADA</h2><p><a href=https://dada.art/>https://dada.art/</a></p><h2 id=women-of-crypto-art-woca>Women of Crypto Art (WOCA)</h2><p><a href=https://womenofcrypto.art/>https://womenofcrypto.art/</a></p><h2 id=defiant-pixel-society>Defiant Pixel Society</h2><p>Ask me for an invite</p><h2 id=clean-nfts>Clean NFTs</h2><p><a href=https://cleannfts.org/>https://cleannfts.org/</a></p><hr><p>A recording of this presentation is available online if you want to rewatch.
