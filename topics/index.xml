In 2020, I decided to quit my tech job to pursue other (tech) dreams.
Whenever someone asks me what I&amp;rsquo;m up to these days, the blockchain comes up.
Most people (both technical and not) at this point heard the term, but nobody is sure of exactly what the blockchain is.
This presentation is my best attempt at communicating what the big deal is, what is going on in the digital world, and what the future might bring.</description></item><item><title>Breaking into NFTs: A Guide for Artists</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/topics/breaking-into-nfts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/topics/breaking-into-nfts/</guid><description>This presentation is open source (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)
