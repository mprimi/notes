<hr />
<h2 id="irl-federation">IRL Federation</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Federation_of_Planets">United Federation of Planets</a> üññ</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism_in_the_United_States">United States</a> üá∫üá∏</li>
<li>Most companies (teams, franchises, branches) üè≠</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Federation</strong>: organization pattern involving a combination of centralized decision-making and as peripheral autonomy</p>
<p>Hybrid of top-down (hierarchical) and peer-to-peer (decentralized)
Ôøº</p>
<!--
* Federation broad concept that exists in different domains
* Sci-fi: Federation of Planets (Star Trek)
* Real world: Federal government of the US
* A large company (say, Google) could be described as multi-level federation of teams.
* Definition: pattern of organization that involves both centralized decision and peripheral autonomy
* Anecdote: Federalism was the hot topic in 80/90s in Italy
    * Idea: give more control to Italy‚Äôs region, rather than collect all money in Rome then redistribute it to-down
    * Even if everyone can agree on federation, it‚Äôs a long way to agree to details
-->

<hr />
<h2 id="federation-in-computer-systems">Federation in Computer Systems</h2>
<p>The abstract pattern of Federation is everywhere.</p>
<p>Often in disguise, or called with by different (more precise) names</p>
<ul>
<li>DNS</li>
<li>E-Mail</li>
<li>Kernel</li>
<li>CPU architecture</li>
</ul>
<!--
* Narrow down the scope to computers
* Federation is everywhere
* One example: DNS, hierarchical, top-down resolution.
    * But federated: authoritative DNS are managed independently
    * Authoritative DNS come and go, independently of top-level
* Handwavy example, don‚Äôt quote me on this one
    * The way Operating System interacts with CPU and schedules on various core
    * Could be seen as federating chunks of work
    * CPU can has some degree of autonomy on caches, pipelining, branching
* Federation is pervasive in computer systems
-->

<hr />
<h2 id="federation-in-distributed-systems">Federation in Distributed Systems</h2>
<p>Concept of federation is broad overlaps with many concepts we encounter everyday:
* Gateway, Router, Facade patterns
* Orchestration pattern
* Microservices &amp; decentralized systems</p>
<p>Federation is abstract and overlaps with these and more.</p>
<p>In the rest of this deck: practical examples of federation in action</p>
<!--
* Let‚Äôs narrow down further to federation in distributed systems
* Federation is everywhere
* But not usually called out explicitly
* Usually because more precise terms exists, sub-types of federation
* Being a broad term it can be confusing
* Example: single endpoint that hides and routes to different services
    * Call it Gateway, or router
* OR service that encapsulates multiple services
    * Making sub-requests, coordinating, assembling the response
    * You would probably describe this as Orchestration or Facade
* In micro services architecture these patterns are everywhere
* Federation term overlaps with these and more concept
* Only if we zoom out and ignore the details, we can see how federation is prevalent
* This is what the rest of this presentation will do:
    * Jump from system to system keep an eye out for federation patterns

<h2 id="data-federation">Data federation</h2>
<h3 id="graphql-apollo"><a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/">Apollo</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below the API, query federation.</p>
<p>Apollo stores no data, it federates the request to other systems.</p>
<p>Data layout, location, provider can change without affecting users.</p>
<!--
* Simple example of federation used to query data
* GraphQL is all the rage today
* The idea: decouple data as seen by users from data as stored or materialized
* GraphQL is a language to define an API for data
* Apollo is a popular implementation
    * Backend is ready to be connected to various datasources
    * DB, APIs, services, ...
* When a user asks for data, Apollo takes care of the details
* At high level, this is an example of data federation
 -->

<hr />
<h2 id="search-federation">Search federation</h2>
<h3 id="maps-search">Maps Search</h3>
<p>Different queries require very different handling, separate indices, ranking, spell-correction model, and more.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Starbucks"</li>
<li>Nearby locations of a specific chain</li>
<li>Or maybe coffee shops</li>
<li>"1200 Main Street"</li>
<li>An address (that exists in hundreds of towns!)</li>
<li>Show the closest?</li>
<li>"1600 Pennsylvania Ave"</li>
<li>A nearby address?</li>
<li>Or a very famous landmark? (the White House)</li>
<li>"Paris"</li>
<li>Paris, France?</li>
<li>Paris, Texas?</li>
<li>(many other)</li>
</ul>
<!--
Search is hard: divide and conquer!

* Service federation
* Break down a complex problem into more manageable parts
* Maps Search
* Open Google Maps and search for ‚Äústarbucks‚Äù
    * Starbucks location near you.
    * What is happening in the backend?
    * Probably, the engine has index of business names and their location, category, and many other details
    * Query includes user location, viewport and more contextual metadata that can help narrow down the most salient locations
* Now search for an address
    * Same address may exists in hundreds of towns
    * Indexing and ranking of addresses is quite different from businesses
    * Furthermore addresses are very different in different parts of the world
* What if I search for a city
    * Paris takes me to France, not to Texas
    * Again, different indexing and ranking
* Same for landmarks, categories, etc
* What I meant to say here is... it gets complicated very quick
* When things get complicated, divide and conquer!
    * Federation to the rescue

<h2 id="search-federation_1">Search federation</h2>
<h3 id="maps-search-architecture">Maps Search Architecture</h3>
<p><img alt="Federated Maps Search" src="federated-search.png" /></p>
<p>A collection of small specialized search engines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Category search</li>
<li>Address search</li>
<li>Contacts search</li>
<li>Businesses search</li>
<li>Landmark search</li>
<li>Geographical entities search</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>And auxiliary services
 - Spelling suggestions
 - User metadata and history
 - Driving time estimation
 - ...</p>
<!--
* Here‚Äôs how a maps search engine may look
* Top-level facade, and it may make use of components I left out (eg. Spelling corrections)
* Delegates search to specialized search engines
* Example: pizza
  * Landmark search and address search may say: I got nothing
  * Business search may return some result with pizza in the name
  * Category search would say ‚Äúpretty sure this is a category search‚Äù
  * Re-issue targeted business search with category ‚Äúpizza restaurant‚Äù
* As far as I know, all major search engines are federated this way
  * In reality, a lot more complicated, for example due to language and other conventions that change over the world

<h2 id="federated-storage">Federated storage</h2>
<h3 id="filecoin"><a href="https://filecoin.io/">FileCoin</a></h3>
<p>Planetary scale decentralized file storage system.
Utilizes the blockchain to track blocks and reward people for storing them.</p>
<p>Mine (get paid) to offer storage capacity
Pay others to store, serve, replicate, ...</p>
<p>Similar: <a href="https://threefold.io/">Threefold</a> (P2P compute grid), <a href="https://livepeer.org/">LivePeer</a> (video encoding grid), and many more</p>
<!--
* Filecoin: Blockchain based global storage network
  * Not a P2P file-sharing (although it is P2P), more similar to S3 than to Napster
  * Not a cryptocurrency (although it does use its own currency)
* Decentralized planet-wide storage system, anyone can participate in
  * Say you have a few spare hard disk at home
  * Set up a node and ‚Äòrent‚Äô your storage
  * To mine Bitcoin you burn burning CPU, to mine Filecoin store chunks of data
  * Data is encrypted
  * A little more complicated than this: different kinds of nodes getting paid to do different things (store, cache, manage)
  * Currently 1 hexabyte capacity
* P2P federation file coin is just a protocol
  * Nodes are independently operated
  * Pricing scheme, strategy, etc
* Protocol Labs (company) is not an intermediary
* Decentralized networks with fractionalized economies are gaining steam
    * Threefold is similar but for compute (think: SETI or Folding @ Home)
    * More specialized: LivePeer for video encoding
    * And many, many more on the horizon

<h2 id="federated-infrastructure">Federated infrastructure</h2>
<h3 id="gaia-x"><a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/">GAIA-X</a></h3>
<p>European Union next generation cloud.</p>
<p>Similar to AWS in that it offers a variety of services, from bare metal machines, all the way up to high level services.</p>
<p>AWS is centralized, GAIA-X is federated through and through.
Only offers the basic protocol for providers and consumers to find each-other and negotiate terms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Federated resource catalogs: compute, storage, bandwidth, ...</li>
<li>Federated services catalog: high level functions, services and API, ...</li>
<li>Federated data catalogs, with varying degree of access, licensing, ...</li>
<li>Federated identity and trust: to regulate and delegate access to data and resources</li>
</ul>
<!--
* An ambitious EU project for next generation cloud
* One way to describe it: AWS but decentralized and federated
* Instead of a single provider of compute, storage, bandwidth anyone can offer their resources
  * Add resources to a catalog
  * Advertise resources specification as well as costs, SLAs, and more
* Applications can use a standard query language to locate and reserve resources, acquire them, release them after use
  * Example: I need 20 hosts with at least 4 CPU, 4GB of memory, 500GB hard-disk. 5 of them need to be located in italy, 10 of them need to be in France, the remaining 5 anywhere inside the EU.
* Similarly, catalogs exist for services and APIs
  * Example: translate this text to language X, Y, Z.
  * Rate limits, number of requests, cost, etc can be negotiated programmatically
* Data catalogs
  * Example: Average household income for asian countries between 2001 and 2011
  * License, usage rights, price are part of the agreement
* In this kind of system, trust is a basic need. Identity and trust are built into the protocol.
  * Naturally, different identity and trust mechanisms can be built-in
* The website has many very cool case studies

<h2 id="gaia-x-use-case-example">GAIA-X Use case example</h2>
<h3 id="medical-records"><a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Artikel/UseCases/framework-of-medical-records-in-europe.html">Medical records</a></h3>
<p>Each citizen has a virtual medical record.</p>
<p>It is stored safely in the cloud.</p>
<ul>
<li>The patient can grant access to a new doctor</li>
<li>The doctor can add to the medical record (and retain access to the newly added data)</li>
<li>the patient can delegate access to a parent or guardian</li>
<li>Research institution may have limited access to aggregate data for statistics and research purposes</li>
<li>Insurance, prospect employer, etc may request partial access</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="federated-service-platforms">Federated Service Platforms</h2>
<p>Uber, AirBnb &amp; co successfully connect demand and supply at scale.</p>
<p>But their primary driver is profit. Above all they need to appease shareholders and investors.</p>
<p>Making users happy is just a secondary goal. A mean to an end.
The real goal is: make money.</p>
<p>Re-imagine these platforms without the shareholders (or making users the shareholders).
Same service, different goal: optimize for the collective good of all users.</p>
<p>More similar to public utilities than to for-profit companies.</p>
<p>Built on open-source (trust is paramount).
Still collect a fee on transactions, but use it to:
 * Pay for infrastructure costs, insurance
 * Compensate employees (support, developers, legal, ...)
 * Reinvest surplus into making the platform better or give fractional dividends to all participants</p>
<p>Examples: <a href="https://www.eva.coop/">Eva</a>, <a href="https://fairbnb.coop/">FairBnb</a>, <a href="https://windingtree.com/">WindingTree</a></p>
<!--
* Marketplace platforms changed our lives in the last 10-15 years
* Companies like Uber and AirBnB have seen incredible success in connecting demand and supply on large scale
* Companies are first and foremost for-profit ventures
* Successful ones manage to balance goals of making money, providing a service, giving people a way to make money
* 3 goals are not always aligned
    * Example: security of riders of ride-sharing app, it‚Äôs expensive to do it very well!
    * Example: protections for drivers, also expensive.
* A new trend is emerging, federated platforms
    * Consumers and providers become the shareholders
    * Infrastructure provided for safe negotiation, contact, reputation
    * More similar to open-source utilities than today‚Äôs startups
    * Eva is Uber, FairBnB is AirBnB
    * These are just 1:1 conversions, But there‚Äôs many more innovative ideas being built

<h2 id="federated-social-networks">Federated Social Networks</h2>
<p>Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, etc.
Are great for staying in touch with friends, discuss current events, and more.</p>
<p>But satisfying user's need for connection is just a mean to an end.</p>
<p>The goal of these platform is to make money to shareholders.
They are not shy of using dirty tricks to get users to:
 * Reveal private information, which they can harvest and monetize
 * Get people addicted, enraged, misinformed, anything required to keep them engaged</p>
<p>User's interests (such as privacy) are only considered if ignoring them is damaging to the platform.</p>
<p>A new generation of federated social platform are emerging: <a href="https://diaspora.social/">Diaspora</a>, <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://mobilizon.org/en/">Mobilizon</a>, and more.</p>
<p><img alt="Expected vs. Actual social network" src="social-network.png" /></p>
<!-- * Social Networks, great tools to keep us connected
* They are wolf in sheep clothes
* Companies make money by mining our data, selling our attention
* Make money by keeping us engaged, to an unhealthy degree.
    * Use dirty tricks to keep our attention: misinformation or inflammatory content
    * These keep us scrolling
* Top diagram - what we want
* Bottom - what we actually have
* Can we do better?
* Definitely yes! Keep the good parts: social connections, exchange of ideas
* Dump the bad: monetary exploitation
* In this space, there are some cool projects gaining steam
* Mastodon: federated twitter
* Diaspora: federated Facebook
* Mobilizon: federated Facebook events
* Set up a diaspora node for you and your friends
    * Pretty cheap
    * Full control on how connected you want to be to the rest of the ecosystem
* Example, if you have kids
    * Safe platform for them to stay in touch with their friends
    * Protected and segregate them from the rest of the internet
    * Same goes with your family, neighborhood, your book club

<h2 id="federated-communications">Federated Communications</h2>
<h3 id="matrix"><a href="https://www.matrix.org/">Matrix</a></h3>
<p>WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, iMessage, GMail, ... provide a great service, but at a (hidden) cost.
Your data is being mined and sold (end-to-end encryption is a marketing ploy).</p>
<p>Matrix is a federated, decentralized answer to this problem.
An open-source protocol for instant messaging (and, communications in general).</p>
<p>Built ground-up to be federated.
Small groups of people can operate their own homeserver, sharing the cost.</p>
<p>Through the homeserver, they can connect to the rest of the world (or not).</p>
<p><img alt="Matrix network" src="organic-social-network.png" /></p>
<!--
* Matrix is the cool new protocol in town
* Federated network of independently run servers
* Each user has a home-server (run by a trusted person)
* Can talk to anyone else in the federation, or keep isolated
* E2E encrypted
* Specification is open source, various implementations available
-->
