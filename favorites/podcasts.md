# Podcasts and podcasts episodes

N.B. some of the content linked here is no doubt "controversial".

Just because I link to an episode where Mr. Baby Eater argues in favor of eating babies, it doesn't mean I'm in favor of eating babies!

Why am I even listening to Mr. Baby Eater? He's evil and a shit-head!
Because I want to get his garbage opinions straight from the horse's mouth.

That way, when I shit on Mr. Baby Eater, because he deserves it, I'm not just parroting the mass-media consensus opinion.
I'm instead expressing my own thoughts and informed opinions.
