6 Months Freelancing
<small>Thursday, Jul 7, 2022</small></h1><p>Six months have passed since I went all-in on working as a freelance. The plan is to give it a shot for at least one year, and see how it goes. This halfway point seems like a good time to look back and reflect.</p><p>Mood-wise, I have been feeling content and satisfied. I&rsquo;ve been feeling fortunate and grateful for the situation I&rsquo;m in. I choose my hours, employer, and schedule. Despite me being choosy, there&rsquo;s still more work than I can ever take on. It feels nice to be wanted, professionally.</p><p>Going back to a (mostly) regular schedule, had a positive effect on my mood. Last year I had no structure; every moment was a decision on how to spend the next chunk of time. Now I&rsquo;m busy, and I had to give up some things I liked, but I&rsquo;m happier overall. While the schedule is predictable, work and projects are not. Almost every day I am doing something new and different. And learning a lot, which gives me the greatest sense of accomplishment.</p><p>Working hourly was an adjustment, and the first few months were stressful. I would count the minutes spent grocery shopping or washing dishes, and convert them into dollars lost. Going to the store is costing me $x, walking the dogs is costing me $y, and don&rsquo;t get me started on vacations! This naggy voice gradually disappeared. I&rsquo;ve stopped counting the minutes. Everything is fine. At the end of the month, I&rsquo;ll still put in my hours and make enough money.</p><p>Speaking of money, the self-employment tax is a b***c! Most of what I have made this year, I will have to turn over in taxes. But it&rsquo;s ok. I&rsquo;m learning and growing. I knew leaving Big Tech would be a would be a significant income setback. I&rsquo;ll make more money next year. And even a junior-like salary as Software Engineer is nothing to complain about!</p><p>Over these six months, I have been working primarily with one company, on a series of related projects. I like this kind of long-term engagement. Altough sometimes I wonder if I should just join said company. I like them a lot, and love their product. But then I remember I much I love spending 100% of my work time doing&mldr; work! No meetings, no email discussions, no chat notifications, no late-night sprints. I have a specific task, and when the clock is on, I feel the duty to be all-in. That makes it easier to be laser-focused and productive, which makes time fly.</p><p>In addition to the long-term (part-time) engagement, I have been involved in two more projects. They were interesting and rewarding. However, going forward, I will think twice about taking on multiple contracts at the same time. The context switch was tough, and I felt I was cheating on both projects by temporarily ignoring one to work on the other.</p><p>Ideally, I would like one contract that pays the bills, probably selling my more marketable skills. And then, in addition, a different amusing project. Eeither something of my invention OR learning a skill I find very useful and/or gripping. My objective for the reminder of this year, is to keep making progress toward this ideal situation.</p><p>I read somewhere &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t research and build at the same time&rdquo;. It always sounded true. 2021 was all about research and exploration, and I was having a hard time producing anything of substance. Exploring was so enjoyable I was worried I would miss it after going back to work. But after six months with my head down working, it turns out I don&rsquo;t. I still have time to chase the occasional rabbit down a hole. But most of the time I&rsquo;m either building or learning or both. And it feels great.</p><p>Overall: no regrets, full steam ahead. Slightly preoccupied, but that&rsquo;s my natural state.</p></div></div><div id=footer class=mb-5><hr><div class="container text-center"><small>Built by <a href=https://www.mpri.me>üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è</a>
