Junk Media Diet
<small>Monday, Nov 30, 2020</small></h1><p>Consuming news through Facebook, Reddit is the brain equivalent of eating McDonalds everyday.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong I love Reddit.
But I hate the Reddit News tab. It sucks time and life away from me.
And correcting this habit is as hard as turning one&rsquo;s diet from burgers and chips to salad and pork chops.</p><p>I need to stay informed as much as I need to eat.
I got my diet under control after years of learning. I eat plenty of amazing food and my belly is right where i want it.
I need to do the same for my brain food.</p><p>Social Media News needs to go.</p><p>My main source of daily news is an aggregator [1].
I collected hundreds of amazing feeds of all kinds.
But I actually never read anything but the daily news.</p><p>If Social Media News is McDonalds, then Mass Media News (CNN, New York Times, Fox, &mldr;) is frozen TV dinner.</p><p>I try to keep it healthy by adding variety[2].
Seeing the same bit of news presented and dressed by different countries or by opposite sides of the political spectrum is great to get a tridimensional view of the actual events, their ramifications, and the landscape around them.</p><p>In contrast, feeding exclusively on news from Facebook + Fox News, or on CNN + New York Times + Reddit is like eating the same frozen lasagna. Every. Single. Night.
If all you have is a freezer and a microwave. Let it it be frozen dinner. But at least add some variety.</p><p>Maybe get together a bunch of sources.
For politics, left wing and right-wing. Centrist and extremist. Intellectual and clickbait-y.
I&rsquo;d like to add more news from more places around the world and local/remote/global communities.</p><p>The upside AND downside of multiple contrasting feeds is the redundancy of the information.
So maybe I could make diverse buckets for different days?</p><p>If treated as the occasional snack, I could still fit some Reddit in the mix.
Just stay TF out of the News tab.</p><p>The rest of my mind diet is not too bad, but it could be better.</p><p>Books are the brain equivalent to vegetables for the body. I believe in eating plenty.
I dedicate a fair amount of time to books, but I&rsquo;m super slow, stopping to think every 5 minutes[3].</p><p>Podcasts and long-form conversation are the protein of my diet.
I&rsquo;m mindful of where my protein comes from. I cook it myself. And and if I could, I would eat more.
Similarly, I wish i could consume more podcasts.
But what i listen to, doesn&rsquo;t go bad. If I get to it in a year, it&rsquo;s still going to be delicious brain food.</p><p>Too often if I go out for a run, I fall back to listening to current events.
So I love political satire is my bacon.</p><p>And then, there&rsquo;s the good stuff.
Which I&rsquo;m just starting to explore and discover.</p><p>Reading a good article can be as joyful as eating a fresh oyster on a hot summer day.
A joy for the senses and wonderful fuel for the body.</p><p>Just like my first time eating sashimi i was diffident, but I quicly learned to love it.
The same way I&rsquo;m learning to love articles and thoughts from semi-anonymous internauts.</p><p>There&rsquo;s an world of delicious, homemade, ethically sourced, organic brain food out there that I cannot wait to explore.</p><p>[1] I like Feedly, but I&rsquo;ll probably switch to something else soon.
[2] Euronews or Al Jazeera. Daily Beast and Breitbart.
[3] Thinking back, I always loved manuals and technical books, and I always struggled with the long dense paragraphs, history for example.</p></div></div><div id=footer class=mb-5><hr><div class="container text-center"><small>Built by <a href=https://www.mpri.me>üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è</a>
