</h1><blockquote>
<p>This entry is an exercise in clarifying my goals for the year and the longer-term trajectory for my career. If you are reading this, keep in mind I am writing for myself. Publishing the result helps me keep myself accountable.</p></blockquote><p>At the start of my sabbatical year, I made a public declaration of my intentions for the year. In retrospect, I am really glad I did!
Those goals served as a guiding light throughout the year, when facing choices like &ldquo;<em>should I learn _?</em>&rdquo; Or &ldquo;<em>should I start project _?</em>&rdquo;.
They gave me focus, removed some options, and decreased the amount of self-doubt ("<em>Is _ a waste of time? No. Practicing this is one of the objectives of the year!</em>").</p><p>2021 has been a year-long experiment in working for myself.
I quite a few doubts at the start of the year:</p><ul>
<li>Will I find work as a free agent?</li><li>Will I enjoy working for myself / by myself?</li><li>Can I be happier with less money?</li></ul><p>After a year of experimentation the answer is a resounding yes.</p><p>I enjoy having a diverse set of opportunities available.
I enjoy creating my own mixture of multiple involvements, roles, projects.
I enjoy having more control over my schedule, more freedom to set direction and proceed as I see fit, on my own path.
Strangely enough, I enjoy making less money, because every dollar it&rsquo;s more valuable, and I enjoy it more!</p><p>The path ahead of me is clear: I don&rsquo;t want to go back to being an employee for now.
The 10 years in big tech were great, but I want the next 10 years to be different.
(Credit where it&rsquo;s due: I am where I am with the luxury of a career change, thanks to those 10 years in Silicon Valley).</p><p>So why leave the safe harbor of Silicon Valley, the home of my industry?
In 2021, I got a taste of leaving the shore and exploring some open waters.
2022 is the year I start venturing out in deep, blue waters on my own.</p><p>I&rsquo;m scared of going off on my own like I&rsquo;m scared to jump into deep seawater.
I know it&rsquo;s mostly irrational, but it&rsquo;s very real.</p><p>I just need to jump in.</p><p>Here are my guiding principles for the year 2022.</p><h2 id=stop>Stop&mldr;</h2><h4 id=-worrying-about-money>&mldr; worrying about money</h4><p>I am very lucky, my craft is in demand. Work opportunities are plenty, and they pay well. If ever need work, I will find some in about 5 minutes.
I can afford to be picky, even if choose contracts and projects based on personal preference rather than salary, I will still make good money.</p><h4 id=-being-a-small-cog-in-a-giant-machine>&mldr; being a small cog in a giant machine</h4><p>For years, it felt great to contribute (in small part) to world-renown products. But lately, the magic was gone, it just felt like I was helping a giant corporation become even more gigantic.
On the other side, seeing my little tacky projects and experiments used and appreciated has made me truly happy.
I should optimize for happiness, get better at building small cute things end-to-end.</p><h4 id=-trying-to-start-a-big-project>&mldr; trying to start a big project</h4><p>I tried for all of 2021 to start a serious/large project, from my rotating wishlist of projects. I couldn&rsquo;t.
While working for others as a freelance is easy, working truly for myself is hard.
Something is amiss, I haven&rsquo;t quite figured myself out, but it&rsquo;s not going to happen overnight. Let&rsquo;s pause this for this year.
In 2022, focus on doing a good job with the existing commitments. They are diverse and interesting. I will learn a great deal. Only little and toy projects allowed, and hackathons.</p><h2 id=continue>Continue&mldr;</h2><h4 id=-balancing-of-work-and-play>&mldr; Balancing of work and play</h4><p>I don&rsquo;t miss being &lsquo;on the clock&rsquo; 9-5 Monday to Friday. However, the upside of that was a well-defined boundary between work and not work.
Today that line blurry. Gradually I found a new equilibrium where I can work more or less when I feel like it. It is way more than 40 hours a week, but almost all of it is enjoyable because I&rsquo;m <em>choosing</em> to work.
I have the freedom to spend time with family and friends whenever I feel like it. The non-working hours give me the energy and desire to be more effective during working hours.
I should continue liberally allocating time (both planned and unplanned) to enjoy life, whatever that means in context.</p><h4 id=-making-space-for-serendipity>&mldr; Making space for serendipity</h4><p>Consistently, the moments where I was further away and disconnected from my computer, were the moments that yielded the most light-bulb ideas, the most profound realizations, the most surprising ah-ah moments.
Similarly, exploration in the digital world &ndash; going down rabbit holes not immediately related to my projects &ndash; yielded invaluable treasures.
I should continue giving myself the freedom to be fully present in the moment, and explore serendipitously.</p><h4 id=-building-my-social-network>&mldr; Building my social network</h4><p>In 2021, I&rsquo;ve had 1:1 over 100 virtual meetings with people I had never met before. It takes work, energy, time to make these encounters happen. And it&rsquo;s absolutely worth it.
100 out of 100 were inspiring and positive, 100 out of 100 made me walk away feeling enriched, inspired, or learned.
I should continue setting up impromptu meetings with people I find interesting, whenever there&rsquo;s a good occasion.
Continue with a balance of new internet friends, and old IRL friends.</p><h2 id=start>Start&mldr;</h2><h4 id=-being-more-selective-with-my-involvement>&mldr; Being more selective with my involvement</h4><p>I ended 2021 oversubscribed on projects/collaborations/engagements. Biting more than I can chew is not good for anyone. Stress reduces my efficacy, and sooner or later I need to drop something.
I should start being more selective, keep a clear list of active projects, and not add anything willy-nilly. I need to start passing up on more opportunities and being ok with it. Don&rsquo;t let FOMO make edits to the list.
A corollary is: be honest and clear with yourself and with others regarding how much time you can dedicate to something.</p><h4 id=-better-define-priorities>&mldr; Better define priorities</h4><p>I often feel like I spent too much time on something that was not important at all. Often is due to detours, yak shaving, procrastination, distractions.
I think the first step is better priorities: recognizing that something is not worth the time I&rsquo;m giving to it.
I want to get better at prioritizing and planning so that fewer hours are wasted.</p><h2 id=other-goals>Other goals</h2><p>Things I&rsquo;d like to level up over the next year.</p><h4 id=skill-graphical-interfaces-front-end-development>Skill: graphical interfaces, front-end development</h4><p>In ~20 programming, I have almost zero experience with front-end and user interfaces. This holds me back: the only thing I can make are for other developers (libraries, APIs, infrastructure, &mldr;).
Going forward, I want to build things usable and useful to a wider set of people, not just developers. To do this, I need to start learning some UI tools, technologies, and methods.</p><h4 id=skill-non-computer>Skill: non-computer</h4><p>In large teams, specialization and deep narrow focus is a strength.
But out here, I&rsquo;d like to level up a broad set of skills I&rsquo;ve never really used before. Such as:</p><ul>
<li>User experience & design</li><li>Research, marketing, advertisement, sales</li><li>Project management</li><li>Communication, writing for me and for others, mind-mapping, zooming</li><li>Entrepreneurship</li></ul><h4 id=skill-scrappy-development-and-hacking>Skill: Scrappy development and Hacking</h4><p>In large-scale systems and infrastructure, a technical mistake can cost the company millions of dollars per hour. Every decision has ramifications, dependencies, side effects. Issues are multi-dimensional, and tradeoffs are non-linear. So for 10+ years I&rsquo;ve learned to tread carefully.</p><p>With the kind of project I work on these days, the result is I think too much before doing. This kills scrappy projects and ideas because I get stuck in the overthinking phase.
I am gradually becoming more effective at hacking things together. I am having a great deal of fun, and falling back in love with programming.
More small/just-for-fun/throwaway/fun projects are the key to getting better at this.</p><p>p.s. the same applies to writing &ndash; way too much editorializing, where I should just throw down whatever comes to mind, then make it better iteratively, or next time.</p><h4 id=skill-deep-focus>Skill: Deep focus</h4><p>I&rsquo;ve gotten better at working in full focus on a particular task (a.k.a. being in the zone, flow state, etc). I could do better: getting there sooner, staying there longer, or more reliably, giving focus to diverse projects, etc.
I should keep observing what works, and try things to make it better.</p><h4 id=goal-find-a-technical-mentor>Goal: Find a technical mentor</h4><p>Good mentoring is equally valuable to both people.
I would like to find a mentor willing and happy to spend time with me regularly (even if it&rsquo;s just for an hour a month).
Who am I looking for? 20+ years of industry experience, ranging from employee to funder. Background in systems engineering (or digital art, architect, applied scientist).</p><h3 id=other-principles>Other principles</h3><h4 id=invest-in-learning>Invest in learning</h4><p>Even if the subject is not of direct practical use. If you have the interest/energy to learn about something, go for it!
In practice: take online classes on things you don&rsquo;t know, read books you normally wouldn&rsquo;t, go to conferences and meetups.</p><h4 id=prioritize-good-for-the-world-over-profitable-for-me>Prioritize good for the world over profitable for me</h4><p>This goes by many names like (golden rule, karma, &mldr;), and it is the base for any decision.
Focus on helping others with pure intentions, this makes the path ahead clear, full of joy and treasures.
The &lsquo;pure&rsquo; bit is important. I should be vigilant and recognize if my intentions are less than pure. If this is a transaction and not a gift, be honest and transparent about it.</p><h3 id=look-ahead>Look ahead</h3><h5 id=3-year-target>3-year target</h5><ul>
<li>Contribute to a few projects that benefit society and the planet</li><li>Live comfortably while working on projects that I find fun, interesting and that teach me valuable skills</li><li>Contribute to retirement funds</li></ul><h5 id=5-years-target>5-years target</h5><ul>
<li>Bootstrap a personal project that outlives my involvement</li><li>Participate as key advisor/architect/contributor to the design and launch of a product</li><li>Contribute sizable amounts to charities, open-source, young people with ideas</li></ul><h5 id=10-years-target>10-years target</h5><ul>
<li>Create a company based on an open-source project I started or adopted</li></ul></div></div><div id=footer class=mb-5>
