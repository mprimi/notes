Worrying about money will only distract you and interfere with decision making.
You are fully funded for the year. And you can find a job in 5 minutes. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about money until 2022.
Be Of Service Seek opportunities for activities and projects that directly impact other people&amp;rsquo;s lives.
Working on a project/startup that build tools or platforms to do future good does not count.</description></item><item><title>Double Whammy</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-11-06-double-whammy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-11-06-double-whammy/</guid><description>Listening to these two on the same day was a bad idea. Soul crushing to say the least.
JRE 1556 - GLENN GREENWALD
Slate Star Codex - Meditations On Moloch
If this wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, I ended up watching Fargo. Great movie, but not exactly uplifting.
This feels sad today, but it&amp;rsquo;s great motivation to make tomorrow great!</description></item><item><title>Junk Media Diet</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-11-30-junk-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-11-30-junk-media-diet/</guid><description>Consuming news through Facebook, Reddit is the brain equivalent of eating McDonalds everyday.
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong I love Reddit. But I hate the Reddit News tab. It sucks time and life away from me. And correcting this habit is as hard as turning one&amp;rsquo;s diet from burgers and chips to salad and pork chops.
I need to stay informed as much as I need to eat. I got my diet under control after years of learning.</description></item><item><title>Karma</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-10-31-karma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-10-31-karma/</guid><description>A few years ago I started to believe in Karma.
It confused me at first because from analytical perspective it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense.
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen things that seem too incredible to be explained. And it became more and more eerie as I figured out the general pattern. Or met other people that were aware of the same mechanisms.
It feels like a hack in the fabric of the universe. You just locally tweak a few variables in your local strategy, and suddenly the whole world unwinds in front of you.</description></item><item><title>Living Out Loud</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-11-08-lol/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-11-08-lol/</guid><description>I saw something interesting while browsing a very well organized collaborative Discord server.
It was a group of channels called Working out Loud. Each channel bears the name of a person, and it&amp;rsquo;s their &amp;ldquo;personal space&amp;rdquo;. Their office.
Most people were using this as a work log. For things like bookmarks, findings, status updates, etc. But of course also funny finds, rants, and conversation with people that &amp;ldquo;stop by the office&amp;rdquo; this way.</description></item><item><title>Notes on GitHub</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-10-27-my-notes-on-github/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-10-27-my-notes-on-github/</guid><description>Can&amp;rsquo;t think of a good reason not to.
As long as I&amp;rsquo;m careful about not sharing something I later regret. ðŸ˜¬
Seems like a good way to establish a presence, build cred, and seed a public PURDAH.</description></item></channel></rss>
