# Double Whammy

Listening to these two on the same day was a bad idea. Soul crushing to say the least.

[Slate Star Codex - Meditations On Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)

If this wasn't enough, I ended up watching [Fargo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/).
Great movie, but not exactly uplifting.

This feels sad today, but it's great motivation to make tomorrow great!
