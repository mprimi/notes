Karma
<small>Saturday, Oct 31, 2020</small></h1><p>A few years ago I started to believe in Karma.</p><p>It confused me at first because from analytical perspective it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve seen things that seem too incredible to be explained.
And it became more and more eerie as I figured out the general pattern.
Or met other people that were aware of the same mechanisms.</p><p>It feels like a hack in the fabric of the universe.
You just locally tweak a few variables in your local strategy, and suddenly the whole world unwinds in front of you.</p><p>The topology changes and suddenly things that were at opposite side are connected by portals and can waltz through them, and I can see other people around me also dancing in this beautiful fractal universe.</p><p>I have no problems in general with the &ldquo;Fuck You, It&rsquo;s Magic&rdquo; explanation.
The name originating from a sticker I was gifted coming out of my first Burn.</p><p>Fuck You, It&rsquo;s Magic.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t argue with that.</p><p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I accept it and move on.
I still want to understand the magic.
Unless I find out understanding it breaks the spell, in which case I&rsquo;d live it alone.</p><p>I&rsquo;m open to any kind explanation.
From counterintuitive statistics, to simulation theory.</p><p>Once recent thought seems like a step towards solving the mystery.
It doesn&rsquo;t explain everything but it&rsquo;s probably part of the puzzle.</p><p><strong>If I give more than I take, then I&rsquo;m more like to accept when something comes my way.</strong></p><p>Take up an invitation, accept a gift, seize an opportunity.</p></div></div><div id=footer class=mb-5><hr><div class="container text-center"><small>🏴‍☠️<br>Built by <a href=#>Marco</a> with
