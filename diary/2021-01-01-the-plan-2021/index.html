2021: The Plan
<small>Friday, Jan 1, 2021</small>
</h1><h2 id=forget-about-money>Forget About Money</h2><p>There&rsquo;s no need to try to monetize your time or your projects.</p><p>Worrying about money will only distract you and interfere with decision making.</p><p>You are fully funded for the year. And you can find a job in 5 minutes.
Don&rsquo;t worry about money until 2022.</p><h2 id=be-of-service>Be Of Service</h2><p>Seek opportunities for activities and projects that <strong>directly</strong> impact other people&rsquo;s lives.</p><p>Working on a project/startup that build tools or platforms to do future good <em>does not count</em>.</p><p>As noble as it may sound, this does not <strong>directly</strong> affect people&rsquo;s lives.
That platform or tool may fail before it&rsquo;s ever finished, or may never be adopted, or may end up doing more harm than good to society.</p><h2 id=local-over-global>Local Over Global</h2><p>It&rsquo;s easier to <strong>directly</strong> affect other people if you know them personally, or if at least you have a good understanding of their world.</p><p>So start there.</p><p>As much as I would like to help people in war-zone, or forests destroyed, or animal species going extinct&mldr; I don&rsquo;t have a clue how to do it.</p><p>So start with helping people around you.
Then take what you learn and broaden your scope (next year).</p><p>Acting local will also have ripple effect that are hard for me to comprehend.
Teaching a man to fish here today, may result in that man teaching other 100 tomorrow somewhere else.</p><h2 id=dont-fight-uphill>Don&rsquo;t Fight Uphill</h2><p>You may see a problem and <em>know</em> you have the answer.</p><p>And yet the people involved may reject your help or your solution.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get stuck. If the terrain is not fertile, move on and find fertile ground!</p><h2 id=always-be-learning>Always Be Learning</h2><p>No project is pointless and unsuccessful if you learned something.</p><p>And learning something new should be sufficient reason to jump into a project.</p><h2 id=stand-still-sometimes>Stand Still, Sometimes</h2><p>With the start of the year, I decided to leave behind a big chunk of my identity (i.e., my successful corporate tech career).</p><p>Before a new story begins, there will be a period of emptiness.
This is sometimes referred to as <em>winter</em> or <em>death</em>, depending on context.</p><p>This period will feel uncomfortable. I will feel empty and worthless.
It&rsquo;s a natural reaction to flail, run around, try everything to get out of this situation.</p><p>But running around may in fact dig me in even deeper.</p><p>I need to embrace the discomfort. Only when I stop fighting it will be able to see a way out.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p><em>N.B</em> this post is backdated. While these thoughts were pretty clear to me by the end of 2020, I didn&rsquo;t have the clarity to write them down until February 2021.</p></div></div><div id=footer class=mb-5>
