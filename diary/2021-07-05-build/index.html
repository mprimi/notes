Just Build
<small>Monday, Jul 5, 2021</small>
</h1>
<p>For the last 6 months, the prime directive has been to explore. To boldly go where I&rsquo;ve never been before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve chased all sorts of opportunities and ideas while fighting back the instincts telling me that such projects are dead ends, not feasible long term, not sustainable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a lot of fun overall, and now that I&rsquo;ve learned to suppress my inner voices of doubt, it is even more rewarding and enjoyable.</p>
<p>So it is probably time for a change. I don&rsquo;t want to get too comfortable.
The 6-months mark seems like a good time to draw a line and set a new heading.</p>
<p>In the next 6 months I&rsquo;d like to <strong>build</strong> something.
No more micro-projects and fun adventures.
I&rsquo;m ready for something big and complicated that will take hundreds of hours.</p>
<p>I am still going to ignore the financial angle and focus on project I love for one reason or another.</p>
<p>In the past months, I have not been able to really dig too deep into any of the ideas I&rsquo;ve had.
Too many other shiny things going by all day. Too many butterflies to chase.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read on some article I can&rsquo;t recall: &ldquo;Building while doing research is a fool&rsquo;s errand. Do your research, then put your head down and build&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This rings true and relevant.
My current environment gives me 10 great ideas a day.
And that&rsquo;s both a blessing and a curse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to end the expore and research phase, and start building.</p>
<p>Over the last month I tried something new inspired by <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/AndreasKling/videos>Andreas Kling</a>: Routine and habits are stronger than willpower.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already unknowingly experienced and taken advantage of this.
For example: I workout every morning. It&rsquo;s not because of the strength of my resolve. It&rsquo;s because working out is deeply embedded in my routine.
If I don&rsquo;t do it, I feel guilty and miserable. It&rsquo;s automatic, I don&rsquo;t need to think about it.
In other words, I am addicted to working out first thing in the morning (and that&rsquo;s a great thing).</p>
<p>Over the last month, I&rsquo;ve applied this mentality to a personal project that had been sitting in my list.
I allocated 30 minutes a day to this activity.
It worked out great!
Even if the project is very low on my list of priorities, I ended up working on it 20+ hours, and I enjoyed every minute of it.
The project looks great, and gets better every day.</p>
<p>Getting the ball rolling on a project has been difficult in the past.
The bigger the project, the harder it is to get going (duh, inertia!).</p>
<p>I intend do narrow down to 3 projects. Then dedicate one full day a week to each project for 3 months.</p>
<p>In 3 months, I should have something to show.
At the very least I hope to be <em>moving</em> on all 3 projects.</p>
<p>To be honest, 3 seems too much. I&rsquo;m afraid with everything else going on in parallel, my focus will be too diluted.
But as of now, I&rsquo;m not able to let go of more.</p>
