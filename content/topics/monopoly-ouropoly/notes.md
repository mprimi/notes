# From Monopoly to Ouropoly

A meta-tale of division, reunion, and blockchain

#### by [mprime](https://www.mpri.me)

<!--
Hello everyone, and thank you for tuning in.

My name is Marco, i go by mprime.

Today, I'm going to talk about Monopoly, the board game.

But of course it's not.
It's about Blockchain, humans, society, and the future.

If you are active in the blochckain space, this talk contains a simple yet important message for you.

If you are a more casual visitor, trying to figure out what the blockchain fuss is about.
There is something here for you too.
We are going to touch ons some of the most amazing AND terrifying things that we can do with blockchain.

# Monopoly, the game (in 30 seconds)

The board

The players

The goal

The people (?)

<!--
In case you're not familiar with Monopoly.
Let me summarize it for you in just 30 seconds.

The game board represents a city divided into zones.

The players start with some money and buy pieces of land, then to build on it.

The objective of the game is to take ALL the money from everyone else.
Bankrupt everyone.

You achieve this by buying land, then building houses and hotels on it.
There's a strategy component, but luck plays a big role (initial cards, dice rolls, action cards).

The citizens that inhabit the city, are not even mentioned in the rulebook.

# IRL Monopoly

Constant competition over limited resources

Unethical, no-remorse strategies

More wealth makes the game easier

...

<!--
It is sad to think how today's world resembles a giant game of Monopoly.

The two mirror eachother in a number of ways:

 - Growing up, we're told there's not enough resources for everyone, so we need to fight for them.
 - This means we're in constant competition over money, land, recognition, fame, ...
 - The more aggressive you play, the more you are likely to win, no remorse for throwing other under the bus, "survival"
 - The more money you have, the bigger the advantage you have
 - With the passing of time, wealth and power concentrate in the hands of fewer people (or mega-corps). Until there's only one owning everyone and everything

# Monopoly in the news

<!--

Next time you turn on the news, or hear a politician talk, i invite you to apply the Monopoly lense to what you are seeing.

Behind every problem, conflict, if you trace it back long enough you'll find a powerful monopoly player.

These players are so powerful to influence government policies, changing laws, tilting economies, shifting borders.

All to further get ahead in the game they are playing.


Just like in a game of Monopoly, the population is barely even considered by this high rank players.

# Ouropoly, the game

Backward compatible!

Same game, different objective: sustainable equilibrium

<!--
Today, I would like to present to you a different way to play Monopoly. I call it Ouropoly.

It's remarkably similar to Monopoly. In fact it is the same game.
You don't need to change any of the rules to play Ouropoly.

The only difference between Monopoly and Ouropoly is the players objective.

Rather than trying to eliminate eachother, Ouropoly players decide to help each-other.

Together they build a sustainable, prosperous economy for the citizens of the city.

It's important to notice that there's no need for radical strategies.

For example, you don't need to go full-on communist and abolish personal property!
Or go full-on authoritarian and force everyone to cooperate.
And no need to take out the guillotine for players that want to play regular monopoly.

Players are still individuals. They own what they own, the make their own decisions.

Simply by changing the objective, volountarily, a few player can transform the game.

From dominance and destruction to sustainable peace and prosperity for everyone.

# Winning Easy at Ouropoly

Plot twist: winning is trivial

Plot twist: scarcity is artificial

<!--
If you do try to play Ouropoly with your friends, (which i recommend) you will learn a couple of surprising and interesting things.

If at least a subset players are playing Ouropoly, it only takes 2-3 rounds to "win" the game.

After that, there's no risk of anyone going bankrupt. Everyone is happy forever after.

Cash is flowing and players can focus on developing the city for the good of their citizens.

This is a very interesting exercise.
One thing we learn through it, is that the scarcity, the core mechanic of Monopoly, was actually completely artificial.

It was a lie.

There is plenty of resources to go around, if we just share nicely and setup a fair collaboration.

# Blockchain

<!--

So we have Monopoly, and ouropoly.

They are the same game, but played with different strategies, lead to very different results.

Next, let's see how the blockchain can affect the game.

-->

# Ouropoly with Blockchain

Win before even rolling the dice

<!--

Let's start with a game Blockchain Ouropoly.

The game is set up as regular monopoly.
Players declare their intention to collaborate.

In addition to verbal agreements, they have access trusted blockchain and can create smart contracts, tokens, DAOs, etc.

Under these conditions, the game becomes suddenly A LOT easier.

Players can encode their alliances, strategy and objectives into smart contracts.

Once you do this, you won.

That's right, you can win the game before even rolling the dice for the first time!

And this is fantastic.

This carries over in the real world game of monopoly.
Blockchain can be used to do amazing things.

Unfortunately, good things is not all we can do with blockchain, we need to look at the other side of the coin before celebrating.
-->

# Monopoly with Blockchain

"There are worse things than death"

<!--

Now, let's try to play Monopoly with blockchain.

As a reminder, Monopoly has the same rules as ouropoly, but players are greedy and want to eliminate each-other.

But now these players have access to a trusted blockchain.

Just one example of a dark strategy you may employ:
 - Do an ICO that looks semi-legit, promise future yield on your land development
 - Anonymously pump it
 - take money from opponents
 - At the right moment, crash your own token price
 - You may lose some, but others may lose even more

This can bankrupt another player that was relying on this income.

In fact, you could do better than just eliminating them.
If you play your cards right, you can financially enslave an opponent.
They can be left alive, but with no control of their action and you just leech on them forever.

This is Monopoly, so players will use whatever is at their disposal to conquer each-other.
The blockchain is not an exception.

The possibilities in this scenario, transposed in the real world, are scary.

# Monopoly + Ouropoly + Blockchain

The current state of the world

<!--
An even scarier situation is when we have a mixed set of players.

Some playing monopoly, some playing ouropoly, some may switch over time, and with blockchain in the mix.

This is the closest approximation to the world we live in today.

Under these circumstances, monopoly players can infiltrate and exploit ouropoly alliances.

Leverage the well-meaning players to build momentum, value, and trust.

Then, if an opportunity appears, swoop in, and transform them into instruments of destruction.
-->

# Good Technology / Bad Technology

UBI, land conservation and restoration, public health and education funds, ...

<!--
What i mean to say with this examples, is something rather obvious.

The blockchain, like any other technology is neither good nor bad.

It definitely CAN be used to do amazing things.

For example, is giving us the instruments to create universal basic income, land conservation, water cleanup, public health and education programs.

And we can do all these things in just a few clicks in P2P fashion, without waiting for our governments or platforms to step in and solve these problems.

-->

---

# Unintended consequences

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" (and will be used for nefarious purposes)

<!--
But with great power comes great responsibility.
And possibly a lot of unintended side-effects!

The same technology that can do great things, will also be used to do terrible things.

Take your least favorite villain of choice. Dictator, Wall Streets, Nestle.

It will come a moment when they will try to leverage blockchain to benefit their the game of monopoly.

It is hard or even impossible to predict HOW this will happen.

But it's pretty easy to predict it WILL happen.
Because that's what happens with every technology ever.

From the invention of paper, to steam engine, to the internet to bitcoin.

Think of any technology, and you'll easily come up with ways it made our lives better.
And ways it was used to submit, kill, dominate, destroy, pollute.

Even the game itself of monopoly was created to educate kids about the dangerous sides of indiscriminate capitalism.
And it ended up teaching kids that this is a dog-eat-dog world.

I can go on forever with examples, but I hope you get my point.

Blockchain, like every other technology will be used for good and will be used for bad.

It's just matter of time before a creative monopoly player finds a way.

This already started, and will get worse in the years to come.

# Hope

What game are you playing?

<!--

So what am I saying?

Are we doomed? Will Moloch always win? Are we stuck in game of monopoly?

I don't think so.

This is a message of hope that i want to pass to you.

I love blockchain but I don't expect it to automagically solve all problems in the world.

My hope comes from the realization that to change the world, we don't need to change the rules of the game.

What the future brings is mostly a function of our collective strategy.

Together we are strong, and the blockchain CAN help us bring us together in ways that were not possible before.

If enough of us start playing ouropoly, rather than monopoly, we can turn this planetary game around.

My final message for you is the following:

If you're involved in blockchain projects with building, funding, contributing.

I invite to often stop and ask yourself:

"Is this thing I'm about to do, is it a monopoly move, or an ouropoly move?"

It may seem trivial and small adjustment, but if enough of us do apply this mentality, we are unstoppable, and together we can change the future.
