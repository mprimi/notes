# Monopoly vs. Ouropoly

A meta-tale of division, reunion, and blockchain

#### by [mprime]()

<!--
Hello everyone and thank you for tuning in.

This is a presentation is about Monopoly, the board game.

But of course it's not.
It's mostly about Blockchain. And other similar technologies that may shape the future of this planet.

If you live and breathe blockchain, this talk contains important message for you.

And if you're just curious about technology or blockchain, there is something here for you too.

# Monopoly, the game (in 30 seconds)

The board

The players

The goal

The people (?)

<!--
In case you're not familiar with the famous board game of Monopoly, let me summarize it for you in 30 seconds.

The board represents real estate, a city divided into zones.

The players start with some money and buy pieces of undeveloped land, to build on it.

The objective is to take all the money in the game. Making everyone else broke in the process.
You achieve this by building houses and hotels, so that other players lose money whenever they accidentally stop on your land.

The citizens that inhabit the city, are not even mentioned in the rulebook.

# Dog-Eat-Dog world

Generations raised playing Monopoly...

What can possibly go wrong?

<!--

Entire generation, like mine, grew up playing monopoly.

It is perhaps not surprising that today's world resembles a giant game of Monopoly.

For example we grow up knowing:

 - We have to work hard and elbow each-other to conquer our little slice of the pie
 - My success is your demise, we are in constant competition for money, fame, recognition, etc.
 - Playing collaboratively may work, but in order to really win at some point you'll need screw over everyone, even your allies
 - Players that adopt aggressive strategy, and have no remorse, have an advantage
 - The richer you are, the easier the game becomes

This are just some of the similarities between a game of Monopoly and the real world we live in.

We see everyday "successful" Monopoly players doing things influencing governments, changing laws, tilting economies, shifting borders.
All to further get ahead in the game.

Over time, wealth concentrates more and more in the hands of fewer and fewer people.
Until there's only one person or mega-corp owning everything and everyone.

Just like in a game of Monopoly, the population is barely even considered by this high roller players.

# Chicken and egg

<!--
Did a board game contribute to creating the situation we have today?
Teaching generations of kids this is a dog-eat-dog world ended up creating such world?

Or is the board game just a good description of the society we live in?

Probably a little bit of both. It's complicated.

# Ouropoly, the game

Backward compatible with Monopoly rules.

"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together"

<!--

I would like to present to you a different way to play Monopoly. I call it Ouropoly.

It's remarkably similar to Monopoly. In fact it is the same game.
You don't need to change any of the rules to play Ouropoly.

The only change is to the players strategy.

In Ouropoly, players simply decide to cooperate long term.
Instead of trying to eliminate each-other, player help each-other.
Together they build a sustainable, robust economy where citizens can thrive.

It's important to notice that there's no need to go full-communist and seize everybody's assets for good.
Players get to keep what they own, the bank still operates normally, and grows with the city economy.

There's also no need to go authoritarian and force players into this strategy.
Only willing participants join the alliance.
-->

---

# Collaborative Strategies

<!--

So what does a collaborative strategy look like in a game of Ouropoly?

There are hundreds of different strategies that can be used to achieve a long term equilibrium.

 - Waive transit fees
 - Create funds to use in case of hardship
 - Land development agreements

Player collaboration in a game of Ouropoly, may look very similar to an alliance or cartel in a game of Monopoly.
The difference is subtle but important.

And it resides in the player's long-term intention.


When a player needs to make a decision between actions A and B and none.
If playing Ouropoly, they think "is this good for the town long-term sustainability?"
If playing Monopoly, they think "how do i take advantage of this to get ahead?"
-->

# WINNING

<!--
If you do try to play Ouropoly with your friends, you will quickly learn a couple of surprising things.

Even without a pre-arrange strategy, it only takes 2-3 rounds to "win" the game.
After that, there's no risk of anyone going bankrupt. Everyone is happy forever after.
Cash flows, and players can focus on developing the city for the good of their citizens (for example, less dense housing, park bike trails, public transport, ...)

And so we discover that the scarcity, a fundamental mechanic in the game of Monopoly, was artificial. It was a lie.
There is plenty of pie for everyone if we just are nice and share amicably!

# Where's the Blockchain?

<!--

What does the blockchain have to do with this.

If you hang out in the blockchain universe you may believe the blockchain is the instrument that can transform a game of Monopoly into a game of Ouropoly.

I share and understand this enthusiasm.
I see everyday the blockchain being used to build things that empower large group of people, and could eventually take on the existing monopolies we have today.
-->

---

# Ouropoly + Blockchain

😎

<!--
If we set up a game of Ouropoly, and give players access to a trusted blockchain, in addition to verbal agreements.

Then we make their lives a lot easier.

Players can encode their alliance code. Smart contract, DAOs can be designed so that no player can betray the alliance.
You can win the game before even rolling the dice for the first time.

And this is fantastics.
If you have friends obsessed with the blockchain and how it will change the future, this is probably why.
-->

---

# Monopoly + Blockchain

😱

<!--

But. It's not that easy.

Let's take a step back.

Let's say we are playing a game of Monopoly (competitive). And we give players access to a blockchain and smart contracts.

It doesn't take much imagination to come up with horrible nefarious ways to put the blockchain to use to dominate and conquer other player.

You can structure deals and contract which rather than eliminating other players allow you to own, control them and leech on them them for the rest of eternity.

Blockchain won't automagically turn a game of Monopoly into a game of Ouropoly.

It can be used to build a bright future. But it can be used just as well to build a dark future.
-->

# Planetary-scale Monopoly

<!--

Moreover planet's game of Monopoly is already underway, it has been for hundreds of years.

Power and money thirsty corporations and people haven't really started leveraging these tools yet.

This is the only reason the blockchain universe still looks like the promised peaceful land of abundance and love

Enjoy this while it last. But brace for impact.

The Monopoly high rollers will come. They're already here.
-->

# Hope

<!--
But there is hope.

If we want to affect the game outcome, and turn this planetary game of Monopoly into a planetary game of Ouropoly...

It's not about changing the rules.

It's not about the technology we decide to use.

It's about the players strategy and their long-term goal.
This is good news, because each one of us can control our own strategy.

Going from Monopoly to Ouropoly is just a mental shift.
It's up to us. You can make the switch anytime and help the people around you do the same.

There are many of us. I meet you everyday. We can do this.
The blockchain will play a role.
It will help by focusing our efforts and bringing us together, but this is bigger than the blockchain.

# Blockchain Developers

🔨

<!--
I have one more word of warning for my blockchain friends.

Back where we started, with Monopoly: the board game.

Did you know, Monopoly was created as an educational game, to teach children about the dangers of monopolies.
It may have had the complete opposite effect: teaching them to backstab everyone, before they backstab you.

This brings me to my last point: unintended consequences.

-->

---

# Unintended consequences

<!--

Good intentions are sometimes not enough.

The creators of Monopoly had good intentions, but didn't expect their game to have the exact opposite effect.

The same is true for innumerable other technologies.

The scientists that studied radioactivity had the best intentions. They didn't foresee it being used to wipe entire cities out of existence.

Satoshi Nakamoto had the best intentions. He didn't foresee his creation helping mega-corporations make billions out of thin air all while hundreds of tons of CO2 every minute.

The architects of the internet had the best intentions. They didn't foresee it being used to break democracy, spread propaganda that justifies genocides and wars.

The list goes on.

-->

---

# Fear

<!--

Even the best intentions can lead to outcomes so bad we cannot even imagine.
Technology is not the answer.

If you are actively involved in blockchain, you have great power, freedom, but they come with great responsibilities.

You should be scared of what you are building.

I'm not saying STOP. In this context, fear is healthy.
You should be asking yourself questions such as:
 - "Can an adversary with a giant amount of money take over my community?"
 - "Will this system enslave the children of the future?"

These are perfectly rational fears you should have.

Fear is your friend. Use it to your advantage.
It will help you to build more secure, sustainable systems.

# Planetary-scale Ouropoly

<!--

I hope you enjoyed this presentation.

And I hope you will join me in the ongoing planetary-scale game of Ouropoly.

To play, we don't need to change the rules of the game.
We don't need to put our trust in any specific technology.

All we need is to collectively change strategy: take actions that benefit the long term health of the planet.

It does not matter how big or small these actions are.
If enough people switch to play Ouropoly, we will win.

Together we will create a sustainable and prosperous future for humankind.
