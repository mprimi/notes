A meta-tale of division, reunion, and blockchain

#### by [mprime](https://www.mpri.me)

<!--
Hello everyone, and thank you for tuning in.

This, is a short presentation is about Monopoly, the board game.

But of course it's not.
It's about Blockchain, modern society, and how the two interact, and how one may influence the other.

And how both may influence the future of this planet.

If you are active in the blochckain space, this talk contains important message for you.

And if you're just curious about technology or blockchain, there is something here for you too.

# Monopoly, the game (in 30 seconds)

The board

The players

The goal

The people (?)

<!--
In case you're not familiar with the famous board game of Monopoly, let me summarize it for you in just 30 seconds.

The board represents a city divided into zones.

The players start with some money and buy pieces of land, then to build on it.

The objective is to take all the money in the game. Making everyone else broke in the process.

You achieve this by building houses and hotels on your land, so that other players lose money whenever they accidentally stop on it.

The citizens that inhabit the city, are not even mentioned in the rulebook.

# Today's World and Monopoly

<!--

Entire generations, like mine, grew up playing monopoly.

It is perhaps not surprising that today's world resembles a giant game of Monopoly.

Here's some of the ways the game and the world we live in are similar:

 - We're in constant competition for money, fame, recognition.
 - There's not enough resources to go around, so we need to fight for our slice of the pie
 - The more aggressive you play, the more you are likely to win, no remorse
 - The more money you have, the more likely you are to win
 - Alliances are possible, but only temporarily, eventually you're on your own

If this sounds familiar, it's because you see the results of these rules of play every day.

Just turn on the news.
You'll have plenty of examples extremely "successful" Monopoly players doing things influencing government policies, changing laws, tilting economies, shifting borders.
All to further get ahead in the game.

Over time, wealth concentrates more and more in the hands of fewer and fewer people.
Until there's only one person or mega-corp owning everything and everyone.

Just like in a game of Monopoly, the population is barely even considered by this high stakes players.

# Ouropoly, the game

<!--

I would like to present to you a different way to play Monopoly. I call it Ouropoly.

It's remarkably similar to Monopoly. In fact it is the same game.
You don't need to change any of the rules to play Ouropoly.

The only difference between Monopoly and Ouropoly is the players strategy.

In Ouropoly, players simply decide to cooperate long term.
Instead of trying to eliminate each-other, player help each-other.
Together they build a sustainable, robust economy where players and citizens can thrive.

It's important to notice that there's no need to go full-on communist and do things like abolish personal property.
Players get to keep what they own and act independently, and the bank still operates normally.

There's also no need to go full-on authoritarian and force players into this strategy.

No need to bring out a guillotine for players that want to play monopoly.

# Collaborative Strategies

<!--

So what does a collaborative strategy look like in a game of Ouropoly?

A long term equilibrium is achievable in many different ways.

Some examples include:

 - Waive transit fees, or make them proportional to the wealth of the player transiting
 - Create pools for to use in case of hardship, to get a player back on their feet
 - Land development agreements

Player collaboration in a game of Ouropoly, may look very similar to an alliance or cartel in a game of Monopoly.
The difference is subtle but important.

And it resides in the player's long-term intention.


Anytime a player is thinking about taking a given action.

If playing Ouropoly, they think "what's the best move for our collective long-term well-being?"

If playing Monopoly, they think "what's the best move to get ahead of everyone else long term?"

# Winning Easy in Ouropoly

<!--
If you do try to play Ouropoly with your friends, you will quickly learn a couple of surprising things.

Even without a pre-arrange strategy, it only takes 2-3 rounds to "win" the game.
After that, there's no risk of anyone going bankrupt. Everyone is happy forever after.
Cash is flowing. Players can focus on developing the city for the good of their citizens.

And so, through this exercise, we discover that the scarcity, which is the core mechanic of Monopoly, was actually artificial.
It was a lie.
There is plenty of pie for everyone, if we just play our cards right.

# Monopoly / Ouropoly


<!--
Just to quickly recap.

Monopoly and ouropoly, are same game.

The only difference is the players strategy and objective.

In the first case, it's a fight to the death.

In the second case is a long term partnership.

# Blockchain

<!--

In the last 10 years, blockchain technology as been gaining more and more momentum.
It feels moments away from going mainstream and taking over the world.

The prevalent feeling is that this is a good thing.
The decentralized nature of the blockchain will empower the masses and give us a chance to hold the power that be accountable.

This may be true. But there's more to it.

Like any other technology, it can be used noble causes, or nefarious ones.

Let's how blockchain may play affect a game of Monopoly.

-->

# Ouropoly with Blockchain

<!--
If we set up a game of Ouropoly. But. In addition to verbal agreements we had before, give players access to a trusted blockchain.

If we do that, then we make their lives a lot easier.

Players can encode their alliances and objectives into smart contracts.
By doing so they bind themselves to the long term plan.

If you play ouropoly with blockchain, you can win the game before even rolling the dice for the first time.

And this is fantastic.

Before celebrating victory we need to explore the other side of this coin.
-->

# Monopoly with Blockchain

<!--

This time, we set up a game of Monopoly (competitive, cut-throat).

Like before, we give players access to a trusted blockchain.

Players may never agree to coordinate using the chain. This is the best possible scenario.

If they do decide to use it, they may create financial instrument that trick other people into debt, or gradually take control of their assets.

This is Monopoly, so players will use whatever is at their disposal to conquer each-other.
The blockchain is not an exception.

The possibilities in this scenario are scary.
For example, rather than being eliminated from the game, you may get enslaved.
Your opponent will control you and leech on you for the rest of eternity.
-->

# Technology

<!--

What i meant to say with this examples, is something rather obvious.

The blockchain, like any other technology is neither good nor bad.

It's about how it's used, by whom, and to do what.

If you want an ironic example: the game of monopoly was invented to teach kids about the dangers of monopolies.
It may have instead educated us to screw with eachother.

The internet was created to give everyone access to all information.
And it's instead used to feed us lies and influence our behavior.

Bitcoin was supposed to liberate us from financial monopolies.
And instead is being used by megacorp to become even richer, while at the same time polluting more than before.

The blockchain is not special, it will be used to do things so bad we cannot even imagine.

-->

# Ongoing planet-scale Monopoly

<!--
Planet earth's game of Monopoly is well underway, it has been for hundreds of years.

Blockchain won't automagically turn a game of Monopoly into a game of Ouropoly.

It can help the transition, or sink us further into despair.

The next few years will be challenging.

We will see some monopoly player successfully leveraging blockchain to their own advantage.

This is really scary to think about.
-->

---

# Hope and Togetherness

<!--
But there is hope.

If we want to affect the game outcome, and turn this planetary game of Monopoly into a game of Ouropoly...

We don't need to change the rules.

We can't rely on any specific technologies to do the work for us.

We need to update our long term strategy and goals.

This is good news, because each one of us can do this today.

It doesn't matter how small and trivial our actions are.

If enough of us do switch from playing monopoly to playing Ouropoly, we are be unstoppable.

Together we can build a brighter future for the humankind and the planet.
