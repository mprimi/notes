title: The Decentralized Economy
---

The invention of general purpose computers, less than 50 years ago, has already had very profound changes.
Computers these days are everywhere: they fly planes, they cultivate our food, and we rely on them for communication, entertainment and work.

Still, this revolution has is still in its infancy.
In the next 10-20 years we're going to see very profound changes to society.

They are just as hard for us to imagine, as it would be for someone 100 years ago to imagine our life today.

Imagine telling your grandfather, we will be wearing computers, they will be tracking our movements, mediate all our interactions, help us get places, and more. They would think you are crazy.

Technology is my world. I've been immersed in it for the last 30 years.
From where I stand, I see a big wave coming.
I'm not trying to tell what to do about it.
You could see the wave and try to ride it.
Or you could hunker down and brace for impact.

Anything is better than being surprised by this wave.

If nothing else, I hope you will gain some familiarity with topics and terms you're going to hear a lot more in the near future.
Things like:

 * Blockchain
 * Cryptocurrency
 * Peer-to-peer protocols
 * Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
 * Smart Contracts
 * ...

This material focuses on just one of the three big waves that are coming, the other two being Quantum Computing and AI.

I'm ignoring the latter two, but I do have similar slide decks for them. Ask me about them if you want.

# Putting things in context

Before we jump into today's topic, I think it's important to frame this moment we are living in on a bigger time scale.

Because when we look at the world over a longer period, some trends emerge.
And these trends are essential to understand where we are and where we are going.

## Access to knowledge

 * 10'000 y.a.: absorb knowledge from immediate group/tribe/family, just enough to survive
 * 1000 y.a.: only kings have access to scrolls and some books. Most of the world spends their entire lifetime farming
 * 100 y.a.: a large part of the world population has access to schools and books are a commodity
 * 10 y.a.: infinite information available to anyone with a computer

## Long-distance communications

Similarly, other things have changed dramatically, like communications
 * 10'000 y.a.: only talk to your family/clan/village
 * 1000 y.a.: kings can send letters
 * 100 y.a.: telephone, telegraph, mail
 * 10 y.a.: talk to anyone in the world

## Access to capital and enterprise opportunity

These profound changes are easy to see.

There's another one which is key for today's topic which is a little more subtle and indirect.
But it's just as important.

And that is: who can start an enterprise, do something bigger than themselves, that requires money, collaboration, coordination among large number of people.

 * 10'000 y.a.: nobody (according to today's history book)
 * 1000 y.a.: kings, emperors, popes, resources are concentrated
 * 100 y.a.: educated people can ask a bank for a loan
 * 20 y.a.: startup. capital access at scale
 * 10 y.a.: any kid with a computer can write an app

In the span of 200 years this changed dramatically, and it's one of the aspect that is going to change even further in the near future.

I hope this exercise of looking 1000 years back provided some insight on the current trajectory we are following.


## Web generations

Getting closer to today's topic, there's another important trend I want to highlight.

The web, internet, is only about 50 years old, but it already changed significantly multiple times.

**Web 0**: Is the world before the internet. Information and knowledge is transferred orally among people, or via books, letters.

**Web 1**: In its first incarnation, the internet gave us access to unlimited amounts of information. All the encyclopedias in the world are available. You can take classes from universities around the world without leaving your couch. You have access to millions of videos, pictures, and books.
During this period, we also see the birth of the first online communities. People can find other people with similar interests regardless off physical distance.

**Web 2**: in the last 15(ish) years, we gradually transitioned to the next generation of internet ("web 2.0").
The web is no longer a large library of information, but it's an interactive parallel universe.
This is the age of apps. The physical and virtual world start to merge.
We can call a car, buy and sell all sorts of things, hang out with our friends.

**Web 3**: is where we are right now. The transition has started already, but it's not yet mainstream.
It's already a billions of dollars economy, but most people don't even know yet it's happening.
This is what this material is about.

Everything covered in this presentation, falls under the `web3` umbrella.

# Bitcoin

## How much is a dollar worth?

Before we get into Bitcoin, I have a little challenge for you: how much is a dollar worth?

In day to day life, a dollar is worth a dollar.
If you give me $50 dollars, i can go out and buy $50 worth of stuff.
This is how we think of money in our daily lives.

But a dollar is not always worth a dollar.
For example, if you are in the business of stealing credit cards, the average exchange rate is actually 1 dollar for 2 dollars.
Meaning, it's going to cost you 2 "dirty" dollars to buy 1 "clean dollars". This is the world of laundering money.

Another example. If you got a loan for a house, you received 100'000 dollars for the price of $120'000.
Each dollar you got actually costs 1.2 dollars.

This gets even more complicated and interesting with foreign currencies.
A dollar could be worth 0.7 euros today, but 0.8 euros tomorrow.

What i meant to say here is: while it's true in our daily lives that a dollar is worth a dollar and it's an universal unit of value.

It is also true that the value of a dollar is whatever the people assign to it.
Dollars are a shared agreement, a convention that hundreds of millions of people choose to participate in.

This realization that the value of a dollar is not something set in stone, it's going to be useful soon.

So keep this in mind for a minute, as we dig into Bitcoin.

Bitcoin was a game for hackers.
Satoshi, the creator of Bitcoin created this computer program, which is kinda like a game for hackers.

He said. Here's a virtual mountain. In the mountain there's a vein of gold.
Anyone can dig and try to extract money, but only the fastest in the bunch will get the next bit of gold.

It's a collaborative game, because it runs on the computers of all the people playing.
But it's competitive because only the fastest get the gold.

And so hackers started playing this game. It may not seem like much to most people, but for someone like me this is super cool.
All of a sudden i'm competing with people from all over the world and tweaking my algorithms and pushing my computer to the limit to mine gold.

This gold has no value. Other than bragging rights. I am the fastest, I have hundreds of Bitcoin, and suddenly someone else is faster, so i want to improve, etc.

These points, or virtual gold have no value. Playing and winning is the real reward.

But then, something magic happens.
This virtual points are widespread enough (in the hacker world) that people start to trade them for other goods.

Imagine you're a kid in California you may trade a Pokemon card with another kid in Georgia for 100BTC.

People start to realize this is a very convenient way to move money.
If you know someone locally that would give you money for BTC, 1c per 1BTC then you can accept online payments in BTC.

Receive the BTC, convert it to dollars. Done.

No need for expensive and slow wire transfers. Keep in mind this is among kids and hackers initially.

This alternative money attracts the attention of other groups of people...
Criminals at first because transfers can be anonymous.

But soon after, all sorts of people start to appreciate the no-fee, instantaneous wire transfers (people sending money back home, people selling stuff internationally, people that don't like banks, ...)

Bitcoin starts to snowball.
The more people know and use it, the easier it is to use.
The more people consider it legitimate and valuable, the more its value grows.

Fast forward 10 years, brings us to today. A Bitcoin is currently traded at $50'000.

It is so widespread and recognized that even Wall Street jumps in.
Not a day goes by today, without an investment firm announcing they're buying a billion dollar worth of Bitcoin.

It is treated similarly to gold: something you buy and park in a vault.
It will probably grow in value as time passes, and it's safe and convenient to store.

Is Bitcoin the future?

No bitcoin is pretty darn terrible. It was a proof of concept, a game.
At the moment, it is literally cooking the planet.
Because very powerful computers all over the world, in the hands of governments are the ones mining all the gold.

I personally don't buy BTC even if I know it is a sure investment. The price is going up.
But ethically speaking, I'm against it. And i wish it would go away.
