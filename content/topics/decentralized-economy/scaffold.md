# The Web Arc

Technology is accelerating our progress

Web 0 - Books, in-person conversations

Web 1 - Online encyclopedias, telephones

Web 2 - Apps, Zoom, on-demand manufacturing

Web 3 - Decentralized web

# The value of money

$1 is not always worth $1.

A dirty dollar is worth about 0.5 dirty dollars.

Money can be printed.

Points, miles, ...

Value of money is function of people's beliefs.

# Part 1 : Bitcoin

Paper money, just for fun, a puzzle

International no-fee transfers, money laundering, local exchanges

Currency, trust = value, the new gold

Wall street, cooking the planet

Civilization unlocked a powerup: Blockchain.
There's no taking back.

## Facepalm intermezzo: ICOs

DIY money

# Part 2 : Ethereum

BTC is single purpose.

Venmo is an app. Smartphones are a platform.

Similarly, in Ethereum, money is an app (a few lines of code).


Cats! Better than real cats, never die, have wings, spit fire, ...

Trading, breeding, selling, ultra-rare cats


Global scale shared computer.

Sophisticated, instantaneous digital interactions that were not possible before (without an army of lawyers).

Compare to trading collectibles IRL

Cats are contracts

Trust in ethereum, open-source, foundation governance, not a company

Not perfect, not alone

(if you're a lawyer, this is a good moment to think about the future)

## Facepalm intermezzo: dark Economy

Easier than ever to move money, evade tax, sell illegal items and services.

Watch for scams.

# Part 3 : Blockchain universe and DAOS

If it's used by criminals, why allow it to exist?

Criminals also use hospitals, cars, supermarkets. We don't make those illegal.

What most people will do with this tech is wonderful. Plenty of examples.

Blockchain is democratic. Lowers the advantage of large corporations.

Ethereum foundation governance, is itself an "app" inside of Ethereum.

Transparent work, decisions, compensation, voting

DAOs a new kind of organization

Cost of creating a startup is zero

Bakery DAO (like a scalable family business)

100s of online businesses already adopted this model successfully

Initially 4 hackers by hackers (e.g., Raid Guild)

But now breaching out to engulf the rest of the world.

Insurance, financial products, consulting, music labels, artist marketplaces, ...

This is the wave that is coming.

Gig economy 2.0: fairer, more transparent.

Uber, Doordash, Amazon, ...: centralized and powerful.

We can replace them with public services

Tinder

Fractional economies: forget the bakery, think Netflix

FileCoin/IPFS, FairBnB,

## Scary intermezzo: black mirror

Population control, social ranking, no privacy

Inoculating against this is the reason for me to share

---

# Part 4: Future

This new enterprise model is already a reality.

Tokens, governance, fractional ownership, ...

"Any sufficiently good idea will materialize"

How will this play out?

US: taxation & regulation, clash between the old and the new

Taiwan: more harmonious integration

CuraDao: economy reboot

Energy in the air: regenerative renaissance

If this goes sideways, we're fucked.
It's up to all of us to build a better tomorrow.

Together we are stronger.
We can take care of the planet and eachother

Switch from antagonistic

Example: this presentation is open-source
