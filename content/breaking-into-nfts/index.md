# Breaking into NFTs: A Guide for Artists

# Hello World!

Thank you to the wonderful folks of [ARTogether](http://www.artogether.org/) for organizing this event.

# *"The truest sign of intelligence is the ability to entertain two contradictory ideas simultaneously"*

[Commonly attributed](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2020/01/05/intelligence/) to author F. Scott Fitzgerald. I choose this theme as a guide for this presentation.

Blockchain and NFTs are controversial topics. Some say they are the best thing since hot water. Others say they are the worst thing ever invented.

There is truth to both.

I will give you, wherever possible, conflicting and contrasting points of view.

Let you decide and form your own opinion.

# `whoami`

My formal title (for the last ~15 years): distributed system engineer.

I make lots of computers talk to each-other, to do stuff that is useful for you.

If you own an iPhone or Apple computer, you probably used some code I wrote.
Same if you ever watched Netflix.

(for context, these are gigantic corporation and software systems, my contribution is minuscule)

Before working as engineer, I was doing Distributed Systems research in academia.
The theoretical work on consensus we were doing back then is the foundation of blockchain.

This is why I love these systems so much. To me they are the coolest thing!

Two thing most commonly associated with blockchain are cryptocurrencies and NFTs.
I am not interested in either. There's a lot more going on that is not discussed in mainstream dialog.

# The State of Internet Services

Before talking about the (supposed) future of the internet, let's talk about the present.

Today, we rely on a number of internet service.

 * Facebook
 * AirBnb
 * Amazon
 * Your bank
 * ...

They make our lives easier in a gazillion different ways.

<TODO graphic>

While they are do different thing, there is an underlying commonality to all these systems.
They are **trusted intermediaries**.

Amazon is connecting you (a toilet paper consumer) to a seller (a toilet paper provider).
Amazon acts as a proxy.

Same for AirBnb and Uber.

If you text your friend on Facebook, you are actually texting Facebook.
And trusting them to text your friend on your behalf.

Companies don't do this out of the kindness of their hearts!
Developing and running these services costs millions of dollar a day.

Yet, these companies are getting richer and richer by the day. How..???

The business model is to capture your data and your attention, and sell it to the highest bidder.

Facebook, Google & co are selling access to your eyeballs to advertisers.
They know you better than you know yourself. This is a literal goldmine for advertising.
They can target exactly the few people that are in the market for a given product.

 > "If it's free, you are probably the product"

# Blockchain and the Future of Internet Services (maybe)

The primary reason I'm excited about blockchain is that it offers an alternative to this model.

Blockchain is a new way to create *peer-to-peer* internet services.

A public, open, secure infrastructure that anyone can use anonymously (or not).

A new way to connect, interact, transact with people all over the world.

The cost of running such service is passed down to the users.
Nothing is free. On blockchain you pay money, on Facebook you pay with personal information.

It is not going to *replace* the current systems.
But it opens the door to create new ones that are not based on the **trusted intermediary** paradigm.

We are just starting to see what blockchain can do.

In 2008, the iPhone was criticized for being an expensive, useless toy.
Critics were right **back then**. But they also failed to see the potential.
There were just a few low-quality apps.
Fast forward to today... it is hard to imagine our lives without a smartphone.

Blockchain is at a similar stage. A lot of the criticism about the present state of the blockchain is fair, but it's from people that fail to see what this enables a few years down the line.

# Blockchain vs Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a single-purpose blockchain.

Bitcoin does exactly one thing: transfer Bitcoin from one wallet to another.

Plus mining, which is the incentive for people to keep the system running so the rest can use it.

General-purpose blockchains such as Ethereum are **platforms**.
They allow the creation and usage of decentralized application (dApps) that anyone can use.

NFTs are a very simple example of dApp (kinda), more on this later.

Current state of dApps is not great (like the iPhone in 2009), but the best is yet to come.

Bitcoin is just one dApp (the first one to become wildly popular).
The best is yet to come.

# Elephant #1: Blockchain is bad for the environment! üò°

~Blockchain~ Bitcoin is responsible for a lot of CO2 emissions. True.

<TODO eth CO2 comparison>

Bitcoin pollution is a side-effect of the world we live in: nobody is paying the cost of polluting.

If you buy toothpaste, use it and discard the tube (very hard to recycle), who is paying for the cost of disposing it? Nobody, we are throwing it in a landfill and passing the problem to future generations.

If we really want to make a dent in the fight for sustainability, how about banning air conditioning, or beer?

Same goes for posting your cat pictures on Facebook, or running AC, or making a bonfire, or playing video-games, drinking beer.

(What is the environmental cost of stocking every supermarket of the world with beer?
From the agriculture necessary, to the chemical byproducts, to the used water, to shipping it all over the world)

Blaming any one thing is addressing a symptom, not the cause.
We need to calculate the true environmental cost of everything else, which I'm all for.

Bitcoin is just the most blatant example of this problem. You can print money by burning electricity. Consequences be damned.

Otherwise it's like taking a heartburn pill. It addresses the symptoms, not the cause.
A better diet is the real solution to heartburn.

(Coming up later: some ways blockchain can actually be good for the environment)

# Elephant #2: Blockchain is used by criminals! ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

~Blockchain~ Bitcoin can be used to anonymously move money. True.

Some other things criminals use:

 * Cars
 * Hospitals
 * Phones
 * Electricity
 * Shoes
 * ...

Should we ban the use of these things because criminals use them to conduct their shady businesses?

Bitcoin makes it easy to move *Bitcoin* anonymously.
But it's actually **harder** for criminals to turn bitcoin into cash. Anyone can follow the money.

Bitcoin creates an opportunity for law enforcements to make it *easier* to track criminals because staying truly anonymous is harder than using cash.

## Part 2: NFTs

What are NFTs. Common myths and misconceptions.
Great, terrible, questionable uses for NFTs.

# Uniqueness

The most common misconception about NFTs is related to uniqueness:

 > A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable

Most common interpretation: there can be only one. ‚ùå

Fungible: can be exchanged for an identical one, or broken up into parts.
Example: a dollar is fungible. I give you a dollar, you give me a dollar. Nothing changed.

Everything else is non-fungible.
Example: the teddy bear you grew up with. There are hundreds of thousands just like it. But you don't value any other one the way you value yours. Yours is **special to you**.

Example: your high school graduation diploma. There are thousands just like it every year.
Yet the one you have has a lot of value and it is unique. It must be whole, if you rip it and give half of it to someone else, the two halves are worthless.

Yet, the way people are talking about NFTs these days is absolute.
I.e. create a school, make a single student graduate, then burn down the school, because the diploma must be unique! üôÉ

# The NFT craze

You probably hear about artists raking in millions of dollars with NFTs and this gives you FOMO.

My suggestion: ignore the noise, keep doing what you are doing.

The only form of art behind these sales is the art of duping rich shmucks by creating artificial scarcity. It takes years of work to grow a following willing to pay for anything you put out. Even if it is a tiny digital image that could be replicated at no cost.

# NFT: Digital certificates

An NFT is a standard to create a certificate.
It contains a little bit of data (often used to point to an image).
It can have "behavior" (more on this later).

From one identity (a.k.a. wallet) to another. May be transferrable to others, or not.

The sender pays the creation ("minting") and transfer ("transaction") cost.

They contain a digital signature of the issuer, so can be verified by anyone, and cannot be faked.

Example: if you have a wallet, I will send you an NFT for attending this seminar, as a thank you.

It's going to live in your wallet at no cost.

# NFT as token of appreciation

## Environment-friendly Christmas or birthday card.

Every year, thousands of trees get chopped to print celebratory cards.
The process produces a lot of waste and emissions.
Then they need to be shipped to stores.
Some get thrown away at the end of the season, cheaper than storing them.

NFTs are forever. üíé
And compared to real card, they are environmentally friendly.

## Proof of attendance

Musician could send an NFT to everyone in attendance at a concert.
Fans could proudly display their collection.

Same for museums, theaters , shows, etc.

# NFT as receipt

## Proof of donation

A non-profit could send an NFT to thank a donor.

This is what WWF is doing, with a series of collectable NFTs representing endangered species.

Donor can proudly display them on their homepage/portfolio.

Loyalty cards for online purchases.

Tickets for in-person and virtual events.

# This is just the beginning

I could barely scratch the surface of what people are doing with Blockchain and NFTs today

And what we are doing today is just the tip of the iceberg compared what people will do in a few years

Blockchain is built from the ground up to be more decentralized and accessible.
(altough no doubt we will see it used for nefarious purposes).

I am overall positive and very excited for what's to come.
