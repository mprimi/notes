title: "The year of the Plum"

This year I cemented my move away from the suburbs of Silicon Valley and into a small town in a rural area. Doing this experiment a couple of years ago turned out to be a great decision. I love living here. Life is slower, people are closer and warmer, I enjoy the trees, the quiet, the smells of nature.
Just a few years ago I could not have imagined moving to a place that on the surface feels quiet and isolated (it is not, it feels warmer and more alive than the denser part of the bay).

I would have a hard time moving back to a more metropolitan area in order to be closer to a company office. But remote job prospects are good, it does not look like I will have to. I feel lucky for this situation that allows me to comfortably live and work from here.

The last couple of years I’ve been freelancing rather than taking a regular full time job. It has been great, I like the clear cut work-in-exchange-for-money agreement.
While I like the theoretical freedom to engage with multiple separate customers, I find myself not really having the bandwidth to do so. It is my tendency to focus in one direction where my contributions are more valuable and appreciated. So next year I’ll give up this dream of working on multiple engagements, regardless of how appealing the various projects are, it’s just not realistic for me. I’d rather be fully committed to one awesome adventure at the time. It unfortunately means turning down other alluring adventures.

Highlights:

Many great nights at home eating, drinking and taking to friends.
Numerous visits to old friends who feel closer than ever.

Two very pleasant visits to my home country and my home town. Finally learning to get along with my family in the few days a year we spend together.

It made me very happy to present a project at a conference I hold in high regards, and get a great response and feedback to it.

It was great to meet in person some of the folks I have been working with on a daily basis. Someone I have been mentoring is making big leaps forward, which makes me proud. It felt good to see some of my contributions have a sizable impact and produce words of praise and recognition.

Assorted memorable moments: N’ombra de Vin, DragonCon, Halloween on Florence, Delle Aie, La Scala, Tropea, Goat Sanctuary, Luna Stage.
