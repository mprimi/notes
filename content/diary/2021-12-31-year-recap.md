> A worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you canâ€™t believe how ignorant you were a year earlier -- [Kevin Kelly](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/)

As my sabbatical year comes to an end, I find myself asking: did i waste this year chasing butterflies, and being lazy? Or I did exactly what I was supposed to do, explore, experience, expand?

Most days, I'm pretty confident it's the latter. The year was incredibly enriching.
In an attempt to finally and definitively prove to my self I wasn't just wasting time, I started compiling a list of all the awesome things I could remember.

If I kept my 9-5 job, my bank account would be happier, but I would not have most of the things on this list (to be fair, this year was possible only thank to my 9-5 jobs I held for the previous 10 years).

N.B. A link or mention is **not a endorsement** of a project. It just means it was a positive experience for me.
