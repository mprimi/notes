2023 shall be known as the year of Tiramisù.

I got to swim with dolphins. Incredible even if a lot less dramatic than how I always dreamt about it.

Read a few good books, but none I enjoyed like re-reading Snow Crash & The Diamond Age.

Learned skill/technique of the year: Macro dieting and Renaissance Periodization - Lost weight & built muscle while enjoying food everyday
