**Important**: Just because I listen/link to to something, doesn't mean I agree or endorse it.

This is just food for thought.

While appreciate people saying certain opinions shouldn't be amplified, I respectfully disagree. The way to defeat terrible opinions and ideas is to share these ideas and opinions *with context*.

Trying to suppress them only makes them stronger.
