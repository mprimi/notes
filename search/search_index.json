It confused me at first because from analytical perspective it doesn't make any sense. I've seen things that seem too incredible to be explained. And it became more and more eerie as I figured out the general pattern. Or met other people that were aware of the same mechanisms. It feels like a hack in the fabric of the universe. You just locally tweak a few variables in your local strategy, and suddenly the whole world unwinds in front of you. The topology changes and suddenly things that were at opposite side are connected by portals and can waltz through them, and I can see other people around me also dancing in this beautiful fractal universe. I have no problems in general with the \"Fuck You, It's Magic\" explanation. The name originating from a sticker I was gifted coming out of my first Burn. Fuck You, It's Magic. I can't argue with that. But that doesn't mean I accept it and move on. I still want to understand the magic. Unless I find out understanding it breaks the spell, in which case I'd live it alone. I'm open to any kind explanation. From counterintuitive statistics, to simulation theory. Once recent thought seems like a step towards solving the mystery. It doesn't explain everything but it's probably part of the puzzle. If I give more than I take, then I'm more like to accept when something comes my way. Take up an invitation, accept a gift, seize an opportunity.","title":"Karma"},{"location":"diary/2020-10-31-karma/#karma","text":"A few years ago I started to believe in Karma.

It was a group of channels called Working out Loud . Each channel bears the name of a person, and it's their \"personal space\". Their office. Most people were using this as a work log . For things like bookmarks, findings, status updates, etc. But of course also funny finds, rants, and conversation with people that \"stop by the office\" this way. Everyone can choose to follow this feeds from collaborators. I think the Working out Loud meme is brilliant. What I want to do on this repository is some version of Live out Loud ([1]). Browse out loud, learn out loud, think out loud. This is nothing new, Facebook and Instagram are Living out Loud platforms too. And countless others before. Modern social media however, is very high throughput. The platform feeds me updates continuously. And prods me to produce new ones for others to consume. I would like this sharing to be nothing like that. I would like this to be slow and organic. Like growing a tree over the years. And I would like it to be useful to present and future Internauts, as well as being a good representation of some sides of me. Earlier today, Seneca, provided some clarity: You demand an account of my days - generally as well as individually. You think well of me if you suppose that there is nothing in them for me to hide. And we should, indeed, live as if we were in public view, and think, too, as if someone could peer into the inmost recesses of our hearts'- which someone can!

Don't get me wrong I love Reddit. But I hate the Reddit News tab. It sucks time and life away from me. And correcting this habit is as hard as turning one's diet from burgers and chips to salad and pork chops. I need to stay informed as much as I need to eat. I got my diet under control after years of learning. I eat plenty of amazing food and my belly is right where i want it. I need to do the same for my brain food. Social Media News needs to go. My main source of daily news is an aggregator [1]. I collected hundreds of amazing feeds of all kinds. But I actually never read anything but the daily news. If Social Media News is McDonalds, then Mass Media News (CNN, New York Times, Fox, ...) is frozen TV dinner. I try to keep it healthy by adding variety[2]. Seeing the same bit of news presented and dressed by different countries or by opposite sides of the political spectrum is great to get a tridimensional view of the actual events, their ramifications, and the landscape around them. In contrast, feeding exclusively on news from Facebook + Fox News, or on CNN + New York Times + Reddit is like eating the same frozen lasagna. Every. Single. Night. If all you have is a freezer and a microwave. Let it it be frozen dinner. But at least add some variety. Maybe get together a bunch of sources. For politics, left wing and right-wing. Centrist and extremist. Intellectual and clickbait-y. I'd like to add more news from more places around the world and local/remote/global communities. The upside AND downside of multiple contrasting feeds is the redundancy of the information. So maybe I could make diverse buckets for different days? If treated as the occasional snack, I could still fit some Reddit in the mix. Just stay TF out of the News tab. The rest of my mind diet is not too bad, but it could be better. Books are the brain equivalent to vegetables for the body. I believe in eating plenty. I dedicate a fair amount of time to books, but I'm super slow, stopping to think every 5 minutes[3]. Podcasts and long-form conversation are the protein of my diet. I'm mindful of where my protein comes from. I cook it myself. And and if I could, I would eat more. Similarly, I wish i could consume more podcasts. But what i listen to, doesn't go bad. If I get to it in a year, it's still going to be delicious brain food. Too often if I go out for a run, I fall back to listening to current events. So I love political satire is my bacon. And then, there's the good stuff. Which I'm just starting to explore and discover. Reading a good article can be as joyful as eating a fresh oyster on a hot summer day. A joy for the senses and wonderful fuel for the body. Just like my first time eating sashimi i was diffident, but I quicly learned to love it. The same way I'm learning to love articles and thoughts from semi-anonymous internauts. There's an world of delicious, homemade, ethically sourced, organic brain food out there that I cannot wait to explore. [1] I like Feedly, but I'll probably switch to something else soon. [2] Euronews or Al Jazeera. Daily Beast and Breitbart. [3] Thinking back, I always loved manuals and technical books, and I always struggled with the long dense paragraphs, history for example.","title":"Junk Media Diet"},{"location":"diary/2020-11-30-junk-media-diet/#junk-media-diet","text":"Consuming news through Facebook, Reddit is the brain equivalent of eating McDonalds everyday.

This list of questions is designed to make you stop and think a little more about what you are looking for. Before making a choice that you may soon regret. I suggest going down the list twice . The first time answer with the current needs. The second time answer with the needs you expect a year from now (or your best estimate..). Data size What is the estimated average, minimum, maximum amount of data stored? How many artifacts will be created on an average day? How much new data will be created on an average day? How much old data and how many artifacts are deleted? Data and access location Where (geographically) is the data uploaded from? Where is downloaded from? Access pattern Are data artifacts downloaded by a single person, or a small group, or a large group of people? How spread over time are data artifacts spread? Data lifecycle and lifespan Are data artifacts ever modified in-place? Or are they immutable (i.e. each modification creates a new artifact)? How many artifacts are created/modified/deleted every day? Permissions model Should everyone be able to upload, delete anything? Or should each user only be able to touch a specific set of files? Or should permissions change per group of users? How many users? How many groups? Is administrators/workers sufficient, or do you need per-project permissions? Or even per-artifact permissions? Discoverability Which users can see all artifacts? (\u201cSee\u201d as in: know they exist) Which users can see all artifacts for a projects? Which users can see the full list of projects? Integration What kind of actionable notifications? Examples: Upload begun, upload completed, download begun download completed, deleted, moved, overwritten, \u2026 Data classes Are all artifacts more or less the same? (i.e. intermediate production artifacts) Or can you group them into well defined categories? Metadata Which metadata is stored in the file itself, and which is stored in an external database? (e.g., author, project name, creation date, notes from author, next step in pipeline, \u2026) Compression Do artifact shrink in size if compressed? Upload & download speed How important are upload and download speed? Can files be downloaded overnight? Auditing Do you need an auditable log of all operations? (i.e. who uploaded/downloaded/deleted/modified what piece of data and when) Consequences What are the consequences of losing ALL the data? (i.e. the cloud storage provider dumps you) What are the consequences of losing SOME data? (i.e. human mistake) What are the consequences of data being leaked on the internet?

Like any person working on computers, M. struggles with keeping track of changes to files. This is the simplest possible tutorial that explains how to leverage git for very simple personal projects. This tutorial covers: - Versioning of a small set of files for a single person. i.e. personal notes/essay/homeworks/article, ... - Inspecting and restoring of old versions - Backups and sharing with others via cloud This tutorial does NOT cover branching, stashes, resolving conflicts, merge strategies, rewriting history, pulling from remote, fixups, aliases, configuration, etc. There are millions of tutorials out there that can teach you these advanced topics. \ud83d\udcdc Old school versioning We've all done this at some point, it looks something like this: letter.txt letter-2.txt letter-3.txt letter-v4.txt letter-v4-with-edits.txt letter-v4-final.txt letter-v4-final-with-images.txt ... Quiz: In this example, which file is the latest and greatest version? I don't know, and neither do you! If you're using old school versioning, make damn sure you give a unique version number every time you create a new version! This versioning strategy works ok with single-file projects. It creates some little clutter, wastes space on disk and makes your laptop heavier to carry ). But that seems acceptable. This approach breaks down as soon as your project consists of multiple files. One could apply the same \"versioning\" strategy to the entire folder. \ud83e\ude9b The right tool for the job To me, using file copies to version files is using a hammer to drive a screw. If you need to drive a screw, use a screwdriver. If you need to version files, use git . git vs. GitHub git is a tool installed on your computer. You may use it in a terminal or with a GUI. git transforms a folder into a little database and then uses that database to store and manage your versions. You can definitely use git without GitHub. You should probably learn to use git before you even look at GitHub. GitHub is a service from Microsoft. GitLab, BitBucket, and many others offer similar services. What you get with GitHub: * Backups in the cloud -- if you regularly synchronize your git projects with GH, then they are safely backed up if your computer is stolen or catches on fire * Web -- GH creates a website around your repository, so you can easily share a link with a friend, e.g.: https://github.com/mprimi/notes/blob/main/README.md, rather than having to send the file via email. * Collaboration -- i can clone your repository, or send you patches for bugs I spot in your code, etc. collaboration is the main reason for hosting a project on a platform like GitHub, but it's beyond the scope of this document 3, 2, 1, let's git ! Without further ado, let's cover the very basics of git . \ud83c\udf73 my-recipes.git Let's say you have a bunch of cooking recipes you've collected over the years. They are stored in a Word document on your laptop. recipes.adoc A note on convention If there is a $ character at the beginning of a line, it's a prompt. It means i issued a command. If there is no $ , then it's the command output. Lines begining with # are comments Example: # This is a comment $ echo foo <= This is me issuing the command foo <= This is the output of the command Let's see how to transfer and manage this knowledge-base with git . 1. Create a repository A repository is a special folder that acts as a database. I like to name my repository folder project-name.git to easily tell distinguish a regular folder from a repository folder. But this is just personal preference, you can name your repository however you want. # Create the new empty folder $ mkdir my-recipes.git # Enter the directory (the rest of commands are issued from within) # Turn the current folder (.) into a git repository $ git init . Congratulations, you just created your first repository. This still just looks like an empty folder, but it's not: git initialized an database inside a hidden folder ( my-recipes.git/.git/ ). You don't need to know what is inside this hidden folder. You never interact with it directly. But it's useful to know this is where git does its magic (stores all your versions and other metadata). 2. Add your existing document One way to look think of git is: If you would like to go back to something at some point in the future, then commit it! You may at some point in the future want to retrieve your original Word document, so let's commit it! # Copy the original recipes into the repository folder. $ cp ~/Documents/recipes.adoc . Rather than moving the original file ( ~/Documents/recipes.adoc ) in the repo, I made a copy. Just in case. You really don't want to lose it while you mess up with git for the first time. We can always delete it later. Let's look at the status of your repository folder: $ git status On branch master No commits yet Untracked files: (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed) recipes.adoc nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track) Let's explain line by line: $ git status I'm invoking the status command of git . Which prints an overview of the status of the local repository folder (there are many more commands, ignore them for now, but if you are curious, try git help which lists them). On branch master Branches are an advanced topic, you don't need to care about them for now. However, notice your screen may actually say main rather than master . This is a recent change of convention, but for our purposes it's just a name. No commits yet You just created this repo fresh a second ago, so there's no history at all. If history existed, it would give you a recap of the most recent commit. Untracked files: (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed) recipes.adoc Git is saying: \"there is a file I haven't seen before in this folder: recipes.adoc \". It also suggests \"if you want to start versioning this file, use git add . nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track) This is telling you that you have not staged any files or changes for commit. More on this later. This status is very verbose, and contains help messages. For the rest of this document, I'll use the \"succint\" version, which gives you the same information but more compact: $ git status --short ?? recipes.adoc This says the same as before: there is a file, recipes.adoc and I've never seen it before (' ?? ' means 'untracked'). 2.1. First stage and commit Creating a new version for your repository is done in 2 steps: Stage : select the files you want to include in the next version. Commit : create the next version of the repository, which consists of the changes/files you staged. We want git to start managing/versioning/tracking your recipes file. So first let's stage the file: $ git add recipes.adoc This stages the document. Notice it does not make any change whatsoever to the file. This is true for pretty much all the comments in this document: git does NOT modify your files. It just tracks them and makes copies in the \"magic\" folder. After adding the file to the index (another way to say staged the file, or added the file), take a look at the status: $ git st --short A recipes.adoc It is saying: \"a file i've never seen before is staged\" A stands for \"added\". If you ask for status in the \"verbose\" mode, it probably says the same with more words: $ git status Changes to be committed: (use \"git rm --cached <file>...\" to unstage) new file: recipes.adoc This is also telling you how to \"unstage\". Removing from the staging also does not delete or modify the file, it just means the file goes back to 'untracked' status. Our objective for the first version is to put your file under version control. The file is now staged, so let's go ahead and commit: $ git commit -m \"Adding the original recipes word document\" [master (root-commit) cdab0fc] Adding the original recipes word document 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-) create mode 100644 recipes.adoc Commit means \"create a new version of the repository with all the changes currently staged\". A commit requires a message: a short description of what changed in this commit. The message itself doesn't really matter to git . You could say -m \"cacca\" and it would be perfectly happy with it. Commit messages are for you . Your repository is going to quickly grow to hundreds of versions, and it's going to be nice to scroll them and know what each commit does just by looking at the message. Congratulation, you just created the first version of your repository! Let's look at a status because here is when people can panic. $ git status On branch master nothing to commit, working tree clean I can hear you screaming: \"WTF? Where did my file go???\" As I said before staging and committing do not touch the files they just create metadata. Your file is still there. Go ahead and check. It is not showing up in status because the file has no changes. The file you have is identical to the file git knows to be the latest committed version. So git doesn't even bother showing it to you, git cares more about changes to your directory! 3. Multiple files At this point, you could be happy with what you have: a repository consisting of a single file. Every time you modify the file, you could stage and commit, and over time you would have a versioned file, allowing you to go back to revisit previous versions if you made a mistake. This is good, but let's make it better: split recipes into individual files. $ touch tiramisu.txt cappone.txt carbonara.txt This just creates 3 empty files. $ git st --short ?? cappone.txt ?? carbonara.txt As expected, git is saying: there are 3 files I've never seen before. Let's add a first version of the recipe. For the sake of this example, I'm starting with a very shitty version of the recipes. Edit the files to add this content: Pasta alla Carbonara 1. Cuoci la pasta 2. Aggiungi il sugo Cappone della Nonna 1. Spenna il cappone 2. Cuocilo in forno Let's check status after adding the recipes: $ git st --short ?? cappone.txt ?? carbonara.txt Same as before: 2 files never seen before. Let's create a new version of the repository by adding these new files (with the current content) and creating a new commit. $ git add cappone.txt carbonara.txt $ git commit -m \"Importing carbonara and cappone recipes\" So far so good. Now that you have some history (2 commits) we can look back at it. The log command is the goto for looking at repository history (altough GUIs are usually even easier). The log command has a thousand options, let's stick to the simplest: $ git log --oneline 41330d2 (HEAD -> master) Importing carbonara and cappone recipes cdab0fc Adding the original recipes word document This list the full history of your repository, most recent on top. The first code (e.g, 41330d2 ) it's just a unique identifier for each commit. Yours will be different than mine even if the files are identical, because the commit author and date will be different for your commits. Try this alternative view of history, which includes the files changed summary: $ git log --stat And feel free to explore more log options described in the manual (hit q to exit): $ git help log 4. Make history A git repository records a set of mutation in a specific order. Let's make history by changing a file. Add a step number 3 to the cappone.txt recipe. Edit the file and save. Status should tell you that the file is different than the last version git is aware of: $ git status --short M cappone.txt And the diff command can tell you exactly what changed: $ git diff diff --git a/cappone.txt b/cappone.txt index 825997d..660f0eb 100644 --- a/cappone.txt +++ b/cappone.txt @@ -2,3 +2,4 @@ Cappone della Nonna 1.

You don't need to know what is inside this hidden folder. You never interact with it directly. But it's useful to know this is where git does its magic (stores all your versions and other metadata).","title":"1. Create a repository"},{"location":"topics/git-basics/#2-add-your-existing-document","text":"One way to look think of git is: If you would like to go back to something at some point in the future, then commit it! You may at some point in the future want to retrieve your original Word document, so let's commit it! # Copy the original recipes into the repository folder. $ cp ~/Documents/recipes.adoc . Rather than moving the original file ( ~/Documents/recipes.adoc ) in the repo, I made a copy. Just in case. You really don't want to lose it while you mess up with git for the first time. We can always delete it later. Let's look at the status of your repository folder: $ git status On branch master No commits yet Untracked files: (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed) recipes.adoc nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track) Let's explain line by line: $ git status I'm invoking the status command of git . Which prints an overview of the status of the local repository folder (there are many more commands, ignore them for now, but if you are curious, try git help which lists them). On branch master Branches are an advanced topic, you don't need to care about them for now. However, notice your screen may actually say main rather than master . This is a recent change of convention, but for our purposes it's just a name. No commits yet You just created this repo fresh a second ago, so there's no history at all. If history existed, it would give you a recap of the most recent commit. Untracked files: (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed) recipes.adoc Git is saying: \"there is a file I haven't seen before in this folder: recipes.adoc \". It also suggests \"if you want to start versioning this file, use git add . nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track) This is telling you that you have not staged any files or changes for commit. More on this later. This status is very verbose, and contains help messages. For the rest of this document, I'll use the \"succint\" version, which gives you the same information but more compact: $ git status --short ?? recipes.adoc This says the same as before: there is a file, recipes.adoc and I've never seen it before (' ?? ' means 'untracked').","title":"2. Add your existing document"},{"location":"topics/git-basics/#21-first-stage-and-commit","text":"Creating a new version for your repository is done in 2 steps: Stage : select the files you want to include in the next version. Commit : create the next version of the repository, which consists of the changes/files you staged. We want git to start managing/versioning/tracking your recipes file. So first let's stage the file: $ git add recipes.adoc This stages the document. Notice it does not make any change whatsoever to the file. This is true for pretty much all the comments in this document: git does NOT modify your files. It just tracks them and makes copies in the \"magic\" folder. After adding the file to the index (another way to say staged the file, or added the file), take a look at the status: $ git st --short A recipes.adoc It is saying: \"a file i've never seen before is staged\" A stands for \"added\". If you ask for status in the \"verbose\" mode, it probably says the same with more words: $ git status Changes to be committed: (use \"git rm --cached <file>...\" to unstage) new file: recipes.adoc This is also telling you how to \"unstage\". Removing from the staging also does not delete or modify the file, it just means the file goes back to 'untracked' status. Our objective for the first version is to put your file under version control. The file is now staged, so let's go ahead and commit: $ git commit -m \"Adding the original recipes word document\" [master (root-commit) cdab0fc] Adding the original recipes word document 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-) create mode 100644 recipes.adoc Commit means \"create a new version of the repository with all the changes currently staged\". A commit requires a message: a short description of what changed in this commit. The message itself doesn't really matter to git . You could say -m \"cacca\" and it would be perfectly happy with it. Commit messages are for you . Your repository is going to quickly grow to hundreds of versions, and it's going to be nice to scroll them and know what each commit does just by looking at the message. Congratulation, you just created the first version of your repository! Let's look at a status because here is when people can panic. $ git status On branch master nothing to commit, working tree clean I can hear you screaming: \"WTF? Where did my file go???\" As I said before staging and committing do not touch the files they just create metadata. Your file is still there. Go ahead and check. It is not showing up in status because the file has no changes. The file you have is identical to the file git knows to be the latest committed version. So git doesn't even bother showing it to you, git cares more about changes to your directory!","title":"2.1. First stage and commit"},{"location":"topics/git-basics/#3-multiple-files","text":"At this point, you could be happy with what you have: a repository consisting of a single file. Every time you modify the file, you could stage and commit, and over time you would have a versioned file, allowing you to go back to revisit previous versions if you made a mistake. This is good, but let's make it better: split recipes into individual files. $ touch tiramisu.txt cappone.txt carbonara.txt This just creates 3 empty files. $ git st --short ?? cappone.txt ?? carbonara.txt As expected, git is saying: there are 3 files I've never seen before. Let's add a first version of the recipe. For the sake of this example, I'm starting with a very shitty version of the recipes. Edit the files to add this content: Pasta alla Carbonara 1. Cuoci la pasta 2. Aggiungi il sugo Cappone della Nonna 1. Spenna il cappone 2. Cuocilo in forno Let's check status after adding the recipes: $ git st --short ?? cappone.txt ?? carbonara.txt Same as before: 2 files never seen before. Let's create a new version of the repository by adding these new files (with the current content) and creating a new commit. $ git add cappone.txt carbonara.txt $ git commit -m \"Importing carbonara and cappone recipes\" So far so good. Now that you have some history (2 commits) we can look back at it. The log command is the goto for looking at repository history (altough GUIs are usually even easier). The log command has a thousand options, let's stick to the simplest: $ git log --oneline 41330d2 (HEAD -> master) Importing carbonara and cappone recipes cdab0fc Adding the original recipes word document This list the full history of your repository, most recent on top. The first code (e.g, 41330d2 ) it's just a unique identifier for each commit. Yours will be different than mine even if the files are identical, because the commit author and date will be different for your commits.

Successfully quit once, cold turkey, for about 4 years. Then picked it back up and have been smoking since, but also trying to stop since. Cold Turkey My friend's J's father smoked 2 packs a day for as long as I've known him. One night he saw me smoking, pulled me aside, and told me he had quit. I could quit too. Easy. I just had to read a book. I read the book, Allen Carr's Easy Way To Stop Smoking . I did quit smoking. I did it alone, and it was indeed easy. I highly recommend the book, of course. From it, i learned a great deal about how nicotine affects the body and the mind. One realization that changes the game is: Smoking is not a pleasure. The pleasure comes from the temporary relief from withdrawal symptoms of nicotine. The feeling is fleeing. Sometimes I don't even enjoy the cigarette I'm currently smoking, but I'm already thinking about the next one. It's mentally exhausting to be constantly thinking of when and where the next smoke is going to be. And releasing that tension, when I get to light up, is another pleasing and addictive sensation. Like taking off shoes after a day of work. The book made me think of Nicotine as a little monster that took residence in my mind. It controls me, and makes me do bad and irrational decisions. It makes me go outside in the rain, it makes me feel shamed to smell like smoke, it takes money from my wallet. The stronger I am defending from the monster's attacks, the stronger the attacks become. And sooner or later it always wins. Thinking of nicotine as an evil puppet master really helped. Being angry at it was key to success in my first and only cold turkey stop. Another important learning from the book was the realization that a lot of the common knowledge about quitting was in fact total bullshit. Things like: Nicotine is physically very addictive and I need help to quit (e.g., nicotine patches, hypnosis, ... ) I'm going to be angry and grumpy while I quit I'm going to gain weight while I quit I enjoy smoking and I'm going to miss it Smoking is a great social lubricant and a good way to make new friends ... It was particularly entertaining to see the nicotine monster panic in the first 48 hours of my cold-turkey stop. It got desperate real quick and started throwing the most absurd thoughts at me. Both during awake hours and in my sleep. Off the wagon 3 years not smoking were easy. I didn't have many smokers around me and so I kinda forgot about it. But I was naive to think i had killed the monster. One night I had a couple of drinks, saw someone smoking and thought: \"Just one. Not gonna fall for that crap again!\". That one cigarette just opened the door for the monster to come back alive. It started to give me thoughts such as: \"See? You did have just one that night, you're in control. We can have a smoke every once in a while.\" I kept it at bay for a while, but the desire to smoke was back. Finally one evening I was drunk and sad. And the monster pounced back and got me stronger than even before. Initially I tried to resist. Limiting smoking to weekends, or special occasions. But, like before, the monster would always prevail. Re-reading the book a second time didn't work. Building muscle I've tried all sorts of things to quit in the last 4 or so year since resuming to smoke. From accountabilibuddies to publicly announcing my intentions (I hate to break promises to others so I thought these could work). Nothing really worked. And enjoy smoking even less than I did before because I'm more aware of the nicotine monster. And feel more shame for not being able to kill it off, despite knowing I did it once. There is however one other book that made a big difference in my relationship with smoking in recent years: The 4 Hour Body by Timothy Ferris . This book does not have a chapter on smoking. Tim probably never smoked a cigarette in his life. However the book gave me a lot of insight and wisdom on (among other things) how to build muscle. I took inspiration from the careful planning that weightlifters do to hit a certain strength goal, and applied the same principle to train my \"nicotine resistance\" muscle. My \"exercise plan\" started very slow (10 cigarettes a day). Then, over the course of weeks, I was \"adding weight\" by removing cigarettes. Going down to 9 per day a couple of weeks later, was easy! And then, as soon as 9 was normal and easy. Lower to 8. Then 7, 6, 5, 4 per day (except for cheat day once a week), over the course of about 6 months. I hit a wall at 4. I never really managed to go to 3. But this was still extremely useful. I did still develop some \"muscle\": I can now go for hours without thinking of a cigarette, even if I have them in the house. I can go for dinner or to see my friends, and leave them home. For me, this is something to celebrate. The downside of this more \"healthy\" relationship with smoking is however that the nicotine monster can now use this against me. \"See? You're being so good. There's no need to quit. 3 a day is pretty healthy and cheap!\" But of course, giving back in in full force is just around the corner. One day I'm particularly stressed or something bad happens, and I'll give myself an excuse to just smoke a pack. And the day after I'm gonna keep smoking. And all the progress made so far is wiped out. The mindful approach Armed with everything I've learned in the last 20 years, I'm doing one more attempt. The things I've learned about the monster, plus the muscle I've built will be useful. This attempt is pretty simple and should be familiar to whoever practices mindful meditation: \"just let it go\". The desire to smoke will keep coming. Instead of dwelling on it, I just need to get back to whatever I was doing and let it pass. For days when the monster's assaults will be fiercer (e.g., after a couple of drinks), I wrote down a few motes for myself: You don\u2019t want to smoke. You want the pleasure of the release. The moment you light up, the pleasure is it\u2019s gone. It was an illusion. You\u2019re not going to enjoy smoking 1 second into it. You cannot smoke just one. You\u2019ll buy a pack and smoke it, then buy another pack. You tried everything. You know it\u2019s going to creep back in. It\u2019s going to cost you thousands of dollars. And possibly your life. Like clouds on a mountaintop, let it pass. Be the fucking mountain. Internal Dialogues Once I've made the decision to quit, the monster starts its campaign to get me back to smoking. Some of the recurring attacks include: You've been so good! Already 3 days without smoking! You should celebrate, reward yourself with a cigarette! You clearly demonstrated you can quit. Go buy a pack to keep in the house just for special occasions. How about cheat day this weekend? Just one day a week, smoke as much as you want. Then back to no smoking for the rest of the week. You should invite smoker_friend over for drinks! That way, you can have a couple of smokes without buying a pack! All of these sound reasonably convincing to me (no surprise.. these are the arguments I'm coming up with to convince myself to go back to smoking). They are all traps. All of them, even the most innocent, will inevitably end up with: * Feeding the monster, rather than starving it, which is going to reinforce it * Breaking the seal, making it easier to break it again and again in the future, until I give up again and resume smoking full-time Starving the monster will take time. Eventually it will stop bothering me daily. But I should not let the guard down. When I think I have defeated it (say, in 3 months or in 3 years), it's when I'll also be the most vulnerable to one of these negotiations working on me, and dragging me back into the hole.","title":"Smoking"},{"location":"topics/smoking/#smoking","text":"Some experiences and learning while trying to kick the habit.
