I was spinning my wheels, I felt I was not accomplishing anything.
The last couple of weeks have been great.

Worrying about money will only distract you and interfere with decision making.
You are fully funded for the year. And you can find a job in 5 minutes. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about money until 2022.
Be Of Service Seek opportunities for activities and projects that directly impact other people&amp;rsquo;s lives.
Working on a project/startup that build tools or platforms to do future good does not count.</description></item><item><title>A deck to play with HackMD Markdown slides</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/everything-else/hackmd-slides-sandbox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/everything-else/hackmd-slides-sandbox/</guid><description>Sandbox HackMD reference Features overview

Wether it&amp;rsquo;s for personal use, family sharing, for a small project or for a company.
Too many times, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people draw a short list from household names (Dropbox, Amazon, BitTorrent, &amp;hellip;) and then narrow it down, primarily based on cost.
This list of questions is designed to make you stop and think a little more about what you are looking for.</description></item><item><title>December 2020</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/logs/2020-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/logs/2020-12/</guid><description>https://blogs.webmd.com/mental-health/20190829/how-to-stop-overthinking-8-tips-from-a-therapist

Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong I love Reddit. But I hate the Reddit News tab. It sucks time and life away from me. And correcting this habit is as hard as turning one&amp;rsquo;s diet from burgers and chips to salad and pork chops.
I need to stay informed as much as I need to eat. I got my diet under control after years of learning.</description></item><item><title>Karma</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-10-31-karma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-10-31-karma/</guid><description>A few years ago I started to believe in Karma.
It confused me at first because from analytical perspective it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense.
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen things that seem too incredible to be explained. And it became more and more eerie as I figured out the general pattern. Or met other people that were aware of the same mechanisms.
It feels like a hack in the fabric of the universe. You just locally tweak a few variables in your local strategy, and suddenly the whole world unwinds in front of you.</description></item><item><title>Lecture Series and Courses</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/favorites/lectures-and-courses/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/favorites/lectures-and-courses/</guid><description>Human Behavioral Biology - Robert Sapolsky - Stanford University

It was a group of channels called Working out Loud. Each channel bears the name of a person, and it&amp;rsquo;s their &amp;ldquo;personal space&amp;rdquo;. Their office.
Most people were using this as a work log. For things like bookmarks, findings, status updates, etc. But of course also funny finds, rants, and conversation with people that &amp;ldquo;stop by the office&amp;rdquo; this way.</description></item><item><title>macOS startup service and daemons</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/topics/macos-startup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/topics/macos-startup/</guid><description>Reference to find and stop annoying applications and services that auto-start on login or auto-restart when killed.
