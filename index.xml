As more and more opportunities, projects, ideas started to materialize I found myself burning a lot of mental cycles thinking about time management. Questions such as:
How should I spend time? Is this thing I&amp;rsquo;m doing a good use of my time? Am I wasting my time? &amp;hellip; The worst part of this is getting distracted by these questions and doubts.</description></item><item><title>Clean Desk</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2021-02-25-clean-desk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2021-02-25-clean-desk/</guid><description>The first 6 weeks of 2021 have been a little rough. I was spinning my wheels, I felt I was not accomplishing anything.
The last couple of weeks have been great.
M. mentioned how he cleans his desk when working on a particular thing. My physical desk is always clean. But my virtual one wasn&amp;rsquo;t. I was used to working with everything open: multiple messaging apps, multiple browsers with multiple tabs, multiple note-taking and TODO lists, &amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>2021: The Plan</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2021-01-01-the-plan-2021/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2021-01-01-the-plan-2021/</guid><description>Forget About Money There&amp;rsquo;s no need to try to monetize your time or your projects.
Worrying about money will only distract you and interfere with decision making.
You are fully funded for the year. And you can find a job in 5 minutes. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about money until 2022.
Be Of Service Seek opportunities for activities and projects that directly impact other people&amp;rsquo;s lives.
Working on a project/startup that build tools or platforms to do future good does not count.</description></item><item><title>Junk Media Diet</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-11-30-junk-media-diet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-11-30-junk-media-diet/</guid><description>Consuming news through Facebook, Reddit is the brain equivalent of eating McDonalds everyday.
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong I love Reddit. But I hate the Reddit News tab. It sucks time and life away from me. And correcting this habit is as hard as turning one&amp;rsquo;s diet from burgers and chips to salad and pork chops.
I need to stay informed as much as I need to eat. I got my diet under control after years of learning.</description></item><item><title>Living Out Loud</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-11-08-lol/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-11-08-lol/</guid><description>I saw something interesting while browsing a very well organized collaborative Discord server.
It was a group of channels called Working out Loud. Each channel bears the name of a person, and it&amp;rsquo;s their &amp;ldquo;personal space&amp;rdquo;. Their office.
Most people were using this as a work log. For things like bookmarks, findings, status updates, etc. But of course also funny finds, rants, and conversation with people that &amp;ldquo;stop by the office&amp;rdquo; this way.</description></item><item><title>Karma</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-10-31-karma/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-10-31-karma/</guid><description>A few years ago I started to believe in Karma.
It confused me at first because from analytical perspective it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense.
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen things that seem too incredible to be explained. And it became more and more eerie as I figured out the general pattern. Or met other people that were aware of the same mechanisms.
It feels like a hack in the fabric of the universe. You just locally tweak a few variables in your local strategy, and suddenly the whole world unwinds in front of you.</description></item><item><title>Notes on GitHub</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-10-27-my-notes-on-github/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/diary/2020-10-27-my-notes-on-github/</guid><description>Can&amp;rsquo;t think of a good reason not to.
As long as I&amp;rsquo;m careful about not sharing something I later regret. üò¨

In 2020, I decided to quit my tech job to pursue other (tech) dreams.
Whenever someone asks me what I&amp;rsquo;m up to these days, the blockchain comes up.
Most people (both technical and not) at this point heard the term, but nobody is sure of exactly what the blockchain is.
This presentation is my best attempt at communicating what the big deal is, what is going on in the digital world, and what the future might bring.</description></item><item><title>April 2021</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/logs/2021-04/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/logs/2021-04/</guid><description>https://blog.tonari.no/introducing-innernet VPN tailscale

Wether it&amp;rsquo;s for personal use, family sharing, for a small project or for a company.
Too many times, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people draw a short list from household names (Dropbox, Amazon, BitTorrent, &amp;hellip;) and then narrow it down, primarily based on cost.
This list of questions is designed to make you stop and think a little more about what you are looking for.</description></item><item><title>December 2020</title><link>https://notes.mpri.me/logs/2020-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.mpri.me/logs/2020-12/</guid><description>https://blogs.webmd.com/mental-health/20190829/how-to-stop-overthinking-8-tips-from-a-therapist
