Choosing Cloud Storage</h1><p>These days there are literally hundreds of options when it comes to choosing cloud storage.</p><p>Wether it&rsquo;s for personal use, family sharing, for a small project or for a company.</p><p>Too many times, I&rsquo;ve seen people draw a short list from household names (Dropbox, Amazon, BitTorrent, &mldr;) and then narrow it down, primarily based on cost.</p><p>This list of questions is designed to make you stop and think a little more about what you are looking for. Before making a choice that you may soon regret.</p><p>I suggest going down the list <strong>twice</strong>.
The first time answer with the <em>current</em> needs.
The second time answer with the needs you expect <em>a year from now</em> (or your best estimate..).</p><h2 id=data-size>Data size</h2><p>What is the estimated average, minimum, maximum amount of data stored?</p><p>How many artifacts will be created on an average day?</p><p>How much new data will be created on an average day?</p><p>How much old data and how many artifacts are deleted?</p><h2 id=data-and-access-location>Data and access location</h2><p>Where (geographically) is the data uploaded from?</p><p>Where is downloaded from?</p><h2 id=access-pattern>Access pattern</h2><p>Are data artifacts downloaded by a single person, or a small group, or a large group of people?</p><p>How spread over time are data artifacts spread?</p><p>Data lifecycle and lifespan</p><p>Are data artifacts ever modified in-place? Or are they immutable (i.e. each modification creates a new artifact)?</p><p>How many artifacts are created/modified/deleted every day?</p><h2 id=permissions-model>Permissions model</h2><p>Should everyone be able to upload, delete anything?</p><p>Or should each user only be able to touch a specific set of files?</p><p>Or should permissions change per group of users?</p><p>How many users?</p><p>How many groups?</p><p>Is administrators/workers sufficient, or do you need per-project permissions?</p><p>Or even per-artifact permissions?</p><h2 id=discoverability>Discoverability</h2><p>Which users can see all artifacts?

Examples: Upload begun, upload completed, download begun download completed, deleted, moved, overwritten, ‚Ä¶</p><h2 id=data-classes>Data classes</h2><p>Are all artifacts more or less the same?

(i.e. the cloud storage provider dumps you)</p><p>What are the consequences of losing SOME data?
